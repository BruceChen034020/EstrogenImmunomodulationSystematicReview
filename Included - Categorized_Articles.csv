This study evaluated the efficacy of ALN in comparison to placebo in preventing bone loss in perimenopausal women with low BMD. Methods Inclusion Criteria: Women, aged 4055, experiencing at least five menstrual cycles per year, confirmed FSH level of > 20 iu/L and lower than 40 iu/L on two separate occasions; reduced bone density T < ‐1.0 of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck. Exclusion Criteria: No patient was enrolled if any of the following criteria were met: patients with hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, liver disease, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloma, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, or polycystic ovarian disease; patients treated with any of the following medications less than six months prior to enrolment: androgens, calcitonin, systemic corticosteroids, fluoride, PTH, SERMS, estrogen, oral contraceptives, bisphosphonates, vitamin D > 2000 IU daily, or vitamin D metabolites; patients not clinically euthyroid or who have had a dosage change of > 25 ug of levothyroxine within the previous year; patients with impaired renal function (serum creatinine > 177 umol/L); patients consuming excess alcohol defined as more than four of the following per day: 30 mL of distilled spirits, 340 mL of beer or 120 mL of wine, and subjects with a history of allergy or intolerance to bisphosphonates. Patients with esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia were excluded. Patients with hypocalcemia (corrected calcium < 2.2 mmol/L), patients unable to stand or sit upright for 30 minutes and patients who had a positive beta HCG test on screening were also excluded. Patients meeting study criteria were randomized to either therapy or control groups Therapy consisted of 70mg of Alendronate and 2800 IU cholecalciferol once per week for one year; Control subjects received a placebo tablet. All patients also received 500 mg of supplemental calcium carbonate daily. Biochemistry tests at baseline and 12 months included: bone specific ALP, creatinine, random urine creatinine, and Ntelopeptide (NTX) in serum and urine. BMD was measured by Dualenergy X‐ray absorptiometry at LS,FN, and TH sites. Differences at 12 months in BMD and biochemical markers were compared. Given random assignment, analysis of covariance was performed with the BMD at 12 months as our dependent, the baseline BMD as the covariate, and group (ALN versus placebo) as a fixed factor. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that in perimenopausal women treatment with alendronate over 12 months is effective in lowering bone turnover and improving BMD at the LS. Early intervention with a bisphosphonate for 12 months in the menopausal transition may be effective in maintaining BMD and microarchitectural integrity.","

This study aimed to describe the clinical features of PLO as a subtype of premenopausal osteoporosis and to evaluate medical interventions for it. Methods: From an administrative claims database including 4,224,246 people in Japan, we classified women for whom the date of childbirth had been defined and who had suffered low-trauma fracture between the ages of 18–47 years as the premenopausal osteoporosis group. A fracture site for which the odds ratio for fractures occurring between 5 months before and 12 months after childbirth (around childbirth) was greater than 1 was considered the PLO site. We classified patients with a fracture at the PLO site around childbirth as the PLO group. The control group consisted of 500 women without fragility fractures. We investigated some drugs and diseases to explore fracture-causing factors, as well as medical interventions such as osteoporosis diagnosis, bone densitometry, anti-osteoporosis pharmacotherapy, and lactation inhibitors. Results: In total, 231 parous women were classified into the premenopausal osteoporosis group. The most common fracture was vertebral fracture and was likely to occur around childbirth, followed by distal radius and sacral fractures, which were rare around childbirth. Considering vertebral, pelvic, and proximal femoral fractures as PLO sites, 56 women with 57 PLO fractures were classified into the PLO group. The incidence of PLO was estimated at 460 per million deliveries. Ovulation disorder and high maternal age were associated with the development of PLO. Vertebral fracture was the most common PLO fracture. It was mainly diagnosed a few months, and possibly up to 1 year, postpartum. PLO patients with vertebral fractures underwent more medical interventions than did those with other fractures, but they were still inadequate. Conclusions: PLO with vertebral fracture was one of the major types of premenopausal osteoporosis. The prevalence of PLO is considered to be higher than previously thought, indicating the presence of potentially overlooked patients. More timely interventions for PLO might lead to the improved management of latent patients with premenopausal osteoporosis and reduce future fracture risk.","

Significant cellular responses to various stimuli involve the formation of inflammasomes, maturation of inflammatory caspases, and caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermin. The function of pyroptosis in disease is complex but not a simple angelic or demonic role. While inflammatory diseases such as sepsis are associated with uncontrollable pyroptosis, the potent immune response induced by pyroptosis can be exploited as a therapeutic target for anti-tumor therapy. Thus, a comprehensive review of the role of pyroptosis in disease is crucial for further research and clinical translation from bench to bedside. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in understanding the role of pyroptosis in disease, covering the related development history, molecular mechanisms including canonical, non-canonical, caspase 3/8, and granzyme-mediated pathways, and its regulatory function in health and multiple diseases. Moreover, this review also provides updates on promising therapeutic strategies by applying novel small molecule inhibitors and traditional medicines to regulate pyroptosis. The present dilemmas and future directions in the landscape of pyroptosis are also discussed from a clinical perspective, providing clues for scientists to develop novel drugs targeting pyroptosis.","

AB  - Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death characterized by cell swelling and osmotic lysis, resulting in cytomembrane rupture and release of immunostimulatory components, which play a role in several pathological processes. Significant cellular responses to various stimuli involve the formation of inflammasomes, maturation of inflammatory caspases, and caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermin. The function of pyroptosis in disease is complex but not a simple angelic or demonic role. While inflammatory diseases such as sepsis are associated with uncontrollable pyroptosis, the potent immune response induced by pyroptosis can be exploited as a therapeutic target for anti-tumor therapy. Thus, a comprehensive review of the role of pyroptosis in disease is crucial for further research and clinical translation from bench to bedside. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in understanding the role of pyroptosis in disease, covering the related development history, molecular mechanisms including canonical, non-canonical, caspase 3/8, and granzyme-mediated pathways, and its regulatory function in health and multiple diseases. Moreover, this review also provides updates on promising therapeutic strategies by applying novel small molecule inhibitors and traditional medicines to regulate pyroptosis. The present dilemmas and future directions in the landscape of pyroptosis are also discussed from a clinical perspective, providing clues for scientists to develop novel drugs targeting pyroptosis.

Objective: To establish the relationship between patterns of BP use and the risk of AFF and hip fractures. Other potential risk factors for AFF were also examined. Methods: This population-based case-cohort study utilized data from the Danish National Healthcare system, including longitudinal records of medication use, healthcare utilization, and x-ray images. Among all 1.9 million Danish adults ≥50, those with subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures between 2010 and 2015 (n = 4973) were identified and compared to a random sample (n = 37 021). Bisphosphonate use was collected from 1995-2015. Fracture radiographs (n = 4769) were reviewed by blinded study radiologists to identify AFFs (n = 189) using established criteria. Traditional hip fractures in the random sample (n = 691) were identified by ICD-10. Results: Compared to <1 year of BP use, 5 to 7 years of use was associated with a 7-fold increase in AFF (adjusted HR = 7.29 [CI: 3.07, 17.30]); the risk of AFF fell quickly after discontinuation. The 5-year number needed to harm for one AFF was 1424, while the 5-year number needed to treat to prevent one hip fracture was 56. Glucocorticoid and proton pump inhibitor use were independently associated with increased AFF risk. Thirty-one percent of those with AFF had no BP exposure.

We present a case of successfully treating CS with MTX as first-line monotherapy leading to significant symptom relief and total resolution of inflammation after one year. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old male was referred from his primary care provider's office to the emergency department due to suspected bradyarrhythmia. He had been experiencing intermittent palpitations, shortness of breath, and near-syncopal episodes over the past few months. On initial presentation, he was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. However, the ECG revealed a complete heart block with a junctional escape rate of 53 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit for further evaluation. Imaging revealed mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral pulmonary micronodules. The patient was clinically suspected of having CS. Despite the initiation of sotalol, the patient developed symptomatic premature ventricular complexes and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and a dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was emergently implanted. An endobronchial biopsy confirmed non-caseating chronic granulomatous inflammation that met the Heart Rhythm Society diagnostic criteria for CS. He was discharged on beta-blocker therapy.Before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, the patient underwent an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography test (18F-FDG PET) scan which revealed multifocal FDG uptake in the LV myocardium and right ventricular wall. After lengthy counseling, the patient opted to forgo corticosteroid therapy and instead was started on MTX 10 mg weekly monotherapy. Due to concerning skin rashes, a skin biopsy confirmed the presence of psoriasis which also responded to the MTX therapy. On subsequent follow-up visits, his MTX dose was increased first to 15 mg, and then later to 20 mg as a maintenance dose with low CRP activity along with monitoring of complete blood counts, liver function tests, and renal function. One year later, a repeat 18F-FDG PET scan demonstrated a significant response to treatment with no focal areas of increased FDG avidity in the ventricular walls, throughout all lymph nodes, and lung parenchyma, indicating no active cardiac and extra-cardiac disease activity. DISCUSSION: Several observational and retrospective studies provide evidence supporting the use of MTX in CS. While these studies underscore the potential advantages of MTX therapy, they involved limited cohorts of patients with CS, and no randomized controlled trials have been conducted. For our patient, MTX was chosen as first-line monotherapy due to patient concerns regarding corticosteroid-related metabolic health risks and concern for device-related infection with recent pacemaker implantation. In contrast to corticosteroids, MTX is typically well-tolerated, and due to its favorable safety profile, it is deemed suitable for prolonged administration. However, evidence for immunosuppression from MTX in CS patients remains sparse. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course in our patient demonstrates that MTX monotherapy can be a viable alternative when corticosteroid therapy is unsuitable. Imaging modalities, including cardiac MRI or 18F-FDG PET scans, may be useful for assessing the efficacy of MTX in patients diagnosed with CS. REFERENCE #1: Obi ON, Lower EE, Baughman RP.

Numerous studies have shown that flavonoids have anti-psoriatic effects by modulating various molecular mechanisms involved in inflammation, cytokine production, keratinocyte proliferation, and more. This study reviewed experimental data reported in scientific literature and used network analysis to identify the potential biological roles of flavonoids’ targets in treating psoriasis. 947 records from Web of Sciences, ScienceDirect database, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane library were reviewed without limitations until June 26, 2023. 66 articles were included in the systematic review. The ten genes with the highest scores, including interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12A, IL-1β, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2), Jun N-terminal kinase (JUN), Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (SRC), Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), were identified as the hub genes. KEGG pathway analysis identified connections related to inflammation and autoimmune responses, which are key characteristics of psoriasis. IL-6, STAT3, and JUN's presence in both hub and enrichment genes suggests their important role in flavonoid's effect on psoriasis. This comprehensive study highlights how flavonoids can target biological processes in psoriasis, especially when combined for enhanced effectiveness.","

AB  - Psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disorder, causes rapid and excessive skin cell growth due to immune system dysfunction. Numerous studies have shown that flavonoids have anti-psoriatic effects by modulating various molecular mechanisms involved in inflammation, cytokine production, keratinocyte proliferation, and more. This study reviewed experimental data reported in scientific literature and used network analysis to identify the potential biological roles of flavonoids’ targets in treating psoriasis. 947 records from Web of Sciences, ScienceDirect database, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane library were reviewed without limitations until June 26, 2023. 66 articles were included in the systematic review. The ten genes with the highest scores, including interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12A, IL-1β, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2), Jun N-terminal kinase (JUN), Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (SRC), Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), were identified as the hub genes. KEGG pathway analysis identified connections related to inflammation and autoimmune responses, which are key characteristics of psoriasis. IL-6, STAT3, and JUN's presence in both hub and enrichment genes suggests their important role in flavonoid's effect on psoriasis. This comprehensive study highlights how flavonoids can target biological processes in psoriasis, especially when combined for enhanced effectiveness.

However, expression profiles of these factors in bone cells under diabetes mellitus (DM) and estrogen-deficient conditions are poorly understood. This study investigated the immunoexpression of ANXA1 and its formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), as well as NLRP3 inflammasome mediators, during remodeling of the alveolar process in diabetic and estrogen-deficient rats. Methods: Twenty adult female Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 5): Sham-operated (SHAM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats received a vehicle solution, and SHAM and OVX rats were intraperitoneally administered 60 mg/kg/body weight (BW) of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce DM (SHAM-Di and OVX-Di groups). After 7 weeks, the rats were euthanized and their maxillae were fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) and picrosirius red or subjected to immunohistochemical detection of ANXA1, FPR2, NLRP3, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). Results: Estrogen deficiency and DM were associated with deleterious effects in bone tissue, as evidenced by a lower number of osteocytes and higher number of empty lacunae in the SHAM-Di and OVX-Di groups compared to the nondiabetic groups. Both diabetic groups showed a smaller vascular area and weaker collagen fiber birefringence intensity in alveolar bone tissue. A significantly higher number of ANXA1/FPR2-positive osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts was accompanied by a significantly higher number of these cells immunolabeled for COX2, NLRP3, and IL-1β in the diabetic and OVX groups, especially in both estrogen-deficient and diabetic rats. Conclusion: These results indicate a possible role for the ANXA1/FPR2 pathway as a fine-tuning/anti-inflammatory regulator to counterbalance exacerbated COX2/NLRP3/IL-1β activation in bone cells during bone remodeling under estrogen deficiency and DM.","

Estrogen has major effects on the immune system and is protective against arthritis. We have previously shown that treatment with estrogen inhibits inflammation and joint destruction in murine models of arthritis, although the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are specialized stromal cells that generate the three-dimensional structure of lymph nodes (LNs). FRCs are vital for coordinating immune responses from within LNs and are characterized by the expression of the chemokine CCL19, which attracts immune cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether the influence of estrogen on innate and adaptive immune cells in arthritis is mediated by estrogen signaling in FRCs. Conditional knockout mice lacking estrogen receptor α (ERα) in CCL19-expressing cells (Ccl19-CreERαfl/fl) were generated and tested. Ccl19-CreERαfl/fl mice and littermate controls were ovariectomized, treated with vehicle or estradiol and subjected to the 28-day-long antigen-induced arthritis model to enable analyses of differentiated T- and B-cell populations and innate cells in LNs by flow cytometry. The results reveal that while the response to estradiol treatment in numbers of FRCs per LN is significantly reduced in mice lacking ERα in FRCs, estrogen does not inhibit joint inflammation or markedly affect immune responses in this arthritis model. Thus, this study validates the Ccl19-CreERαfl/fl strain for studying estrogen signaling in FRCs within inflammatory diseases, although the chosen arthritis model is deemed unsuitable for addressing this question.","

However, clinical studies only confirmed a relatively small portion of the previous findings of the in vitro and animal investigations, including anti-hyperlipidemic effects. In conclusion, in vitro and animal studies have reported potential therapeutic effects for daidzein and daidzin regarding CVDs. However, most of the clinical studies were unable to exhibit the same results. Hence, further clinical studies are required to determine the outcomes of administering daidzein and its derivatives for an extended period and in various doses.

Results: Of 134,022 WHI participants meeting inclusion criteria, 1367 (1.0%) reported IBD at baseline. Mean baseline age was 63.4 years. After adjusting for age and other confounders, no significant difference was observed between IBD and non-IBD women for the risk of CHD (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73–1.24), VTE (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.81–1.52) or PAD (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28–1.42). After adjusting for age, risk of ischemic stroke was significantly higher (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06–1.88) in IBD than non-IBD women. With further adjustment, the excess risk of ischemic stroke among IBD women was attenuated and no longer statistically significant (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.98–1.76). Conclusions: Among postmenopausal women with IBD, risk of ischemic stroke may be higher than in non-IBD women.","

It is known that estrogen hormones reduce inflammation in RA and that this occurs mainly via the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptor-30 (GPR30), also known as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) 1. However, changes in GPR30 expression and sex differences induced by local and systemic inflammation in RA are not yet known. Our aim was to reveal sex differences in the expression and association of joint GPR30 with local and systemic inflammation, clinical course and furthermore with hippocampal GPR30 expression during pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in Dark Agouti (DA) rats, an animal model of RA. Furthermore, we demonstrated sex-specific differences in the association between joint and systemic inflammation and hippocampal microglia during PIA. Our results suggest sex-specific differences not only in the clinical course and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also in the expression of GPR30. Female rats show greater synovial inflammation and greater damage to the articular cartilage compared to males during PIA attack. Male rats express higher levels of synovial and cartilaginous GPR30 than females during PIA, which correlates with a less severe clinical course. The correlation between synovial and cartilaginous GPR30 and joint inflammation scores (Krenn and Mankin) in male rats suggests that the more severe the joint inflammation, the higher the GPR30 expression. At the same time, there is no particular upregulation of hippocampal GPR30 in males. On the other hand, female rats express higher levels of neuroprotective GPR30 in the hippocampus than male rats at the basic level and during PIA attack. In addition, females have a higher number of Iba-1+ cells in the hippocampus during PIA attack that strongly correlates with the clinical score, serum levels of IL-17A, and Krenn and Mankin scores. These results suggest that male rats are better protected from inflammation in the joints and female rats are better protected from the inflammation in the hippocampus during a PIA attack, independently of microglia proliferation. However, in the remission phase, synovial GPR30 expression suddenly increases in female rats, as does hippocampal GPR30 expression in males. Further experiments with a longer remission period are needed to investigate the molecular background of these sex differences, as well as microglia phenotype profiling.","

Finally, CETSA and DARTS validated the direct binding of MTX or LEF to the selected target proteins EGFR, PPARG, MMP9, and SRC in RAW264.7 cells. RESULTS: We identified 292 MTX targets and 247 LEF targets from 7 databases. Furthermore, 2,814 potential targets of RA were identified by merging 1,925 targets from 7 databases and 999 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal controls and patients with RA extracted from 5 GEO databases. Nine pivotal genes, ESR1, ALB, CASP3, EGFR, HSP90AA1, SRC, MMP9, PPARG, and IGF1, were identified.

The development of treatments for the IVD is complicated by the variety of resident cell types needed to maintain the regionally distinct structural properties of the IVD that permit the safe, complex motions of the spine. Osteoporosis of the spine increases the risk of vertebral bone fracture that can increase the incidence of back pain. Fortunately, there are a variety of pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis that target osteoblasts, osteoclasts and/or osteocytes to build bone and prevent vertebral fracture. Of particular note, clinical and preclinical studies suggest that commonly prescribed osteoporosis drugs like bisphosphonates, intermittent parathyroid hormone, anti-sclerostin antibody, selective estrogen receptor modulators and anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand inhibitor denosumab may also relieve back pain. Here, we cite clinical and preclinical studies and include unpublished data to support the argument that a subset of these therapeutics for osteoporosis may alleviate low back pain by also targeting the IVD.","

Osteoporosis of the spine increases the risk of vertebral bone fracture that can increase the incidence of back pain. Fortunately, there are a variety of pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis that target osteoblasts, osteoclasts and/or osteocytes to build bone and prevent vertebral fracture. Of particular note, clinical and preclinical studies suggest that commonly prescribed osteoporosis drugs like bisphosphonates, intermittent parathyroid hormone, anti-sclerostin antibody, selective estrogen receptor modulators and anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand inhibitor denosumab may also relieve back pain. Here, we cite clinical and preclinical studies and include unpublished data to support the argument that a subset of these therapeutics for osteoporosis may alleviate low back pain by also targeting the IVD.

EFFECTS OF CUMULATIVE LIFETIME ESTROGEN EXPOSURE ON THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND COURSES IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS,"['estrogen', 'adult', 'conference abstract', 'DAS28', 'disability', 'drug therapy', 'European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire', 'fatigue', 'female', 'follow up', 'Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability index', 'hormone substitution', 'human', 'lifespan', 'longitudinal study', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'menarche', 'menopause', 'middle aged', 'observational study', 'pain', 'pain measurement', 'patient-reported outcome', 'postmenopause', 'pregnancy', 'quality of life', 'remission', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'Simplified Disease Activity Index', 'sleep disorder']","Background: Since rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is more prevalent among women than men, previous studies have explored the association between various female hormonal factors and the development or progression of RA. Cumulative lifetime estrogen exposure (CLEE) is defined as the summation of endogenous and exogenous exposure of estrogen, and its association with several chronic diseases and quality of life has been suggested. However, none has evaluated how CLEE affects longitudinal changes in the validated disease activity indices or patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of RA over time. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the differences in clinical characteristics between RA patients with lower and higher CLEE using validated disease activity indices and PROs of RA, and to determine the impact of CLEE on the disease course of RA over time using a large nationwide observational RA cohort in Korea. Methods: We included 2878 postmenopausal women with RA from the Korean Observational Study Network for Arthritis. Patients were examined at baseline and for five consecutive years using the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and other PROs. CLEE was calculated by combining reproductive span (age in years at menopause minus age at menarche) and duration of any postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy uses. RA patients were then classified into lower and higher CLEE groups based on the median of 34 years of estrogen exposure. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of CLEE on longitudinal changes in RA activity and PROs. Results: RA patients with lower CLEE (N=1602) were younger (60.1±8.9 vs. 60.8±7.0 years, p=0.024) but had longer disease duration (8.9±7.9 vs. 8.3±7.6 years, p= 0.034) than those with higher CLEE (N=1179). The lower CLEE group had significantly higher disease activity assessed by SDAI (14.6±10.6 vs. 13.2±9.3, p<0.001), CDAI (13.8±10.2 vs. 12.4±9.1, p<0.001), and DAS28 (4.0±1.4 vs. 3.9±1.3, p=0.004) and more radiographic erosion (20.0% vs. 16.9%, p=0.044) than the higher CLEE group at baseline. Furthermore, the lower CLEE group demonstrated worse PROs for global assessment, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, functional disability, and health-related quality of life (all p<0.01) than the higher CLEE group at baseline. The GEE model showed that the lower CLEE group was significantly associated with an increase in SDAI (β=0.518, p=0.007) over time after adjusting for age, BMI, disease duration, biologics use, and SDAI at baseline. The lower CLEE group was also significantly associated with an increase in HAQ-DI scores (β=0.050, p<0.001) and a decrease in EQ-5D-utility values (β=-0.024, p<0.001) during the 5-year follow-up period. Among RA patients with active disease at baseline (SDAI>11), the lower CLEE group was significantly associated with not achieving Boolean remission after adjustment for confounders during the follow-up period [HR 0.597 (95% CI 0.421- 0.848), p=0.004] (Table 1). Conclusion: RA patients with lower CLEE have higher disease activity, more erosive disease, and worse PROs than those with higher CLEE. Moreover, lower CLEE adversely affects longitudinal changes in disease activity and PROs over time and is also associated with a lower likelihood of achieving clinical remission in RA.","

AB  - Melasma is an acquired pigmentation disease that mainly involves the development of symmetrical yellow-brown facial patches. The incidence rate of the disease is increasing yearly. Therefore, actively studying the exposure factors that induce melasma could contribute to the prevention and treatment of this disease. In the present review, the possible exposure factors were summarized.

The impacts of PTOA are well-described, but little is known about the genetic risk of developing OA after knee injury and whether this differs from idiopathic OA (iOA). Knowledge of genetic variants associated with PTOA would improve our understanding of this subgroup of disease. Our aim is to identify genome-wide significant signals associated with PTOA of the knee. Here we present initial work to a) establish optimal methods, including definition of phenotypes and relevant analyses; b) assess cohort feasibility to apply eligibility criteria to identify sufficient numbers; c) generate power and sample size calculations for a discovery GWAS meta-analysis, and d) create an analysis plan. Methods: As part of the Genetics of Osteoarthritis (GO) consortium, investigators from 6 international cohorts/biobanks joined the (GO)-PTOA international working group: UK Biobank, DeCODE, FinnGen, Estonian Biobank, Heredigene and Million Veteran Program. Over 11 months, the group developed and tested methods to identify case and comparator phenotypes with existing clinical and genome wide genotypic data. Knee PTOA cases were defined as either i) ‘time to event (TE) PTOA’ - an eligible acute knee injury and subsequent knee OA/PTOA code, or ii) case code PTOA (CC PTOA) - a knee PTOA code only. These could be combined into an ‘ALLPTOA knee’ group. Eligible knee injuries occurred between age 16-50, due to acute trauma of an internal knee joint structure. A window of 6 months - 20 years between knee injury and knee OA code, or censoring/death was applied. Exclusions were defined, e.g. ever having inflammatory arthritis. Diagnostic codes were adjudicated and compiled from electronic health record systems, primarily ICD-9/10. Availability of covariates to report included age at diagnosis, sex and global ancestry group. Initial analyses and power plots were performed in one cohort, UK Biobank, to inform approach. Results: The group identified 6 related analyses to collectively investigate important genetic variation associated with PTOA using 4 specific phenotypes and 2 subgroups of these. There were 3 primary analyses (1&3 were case-comparator, and 2 was a related time to event model) and 3 secondary case-comparator GWAS analyses (4A-C), relating to associations with the injury itself, or those with iOA: ALLPTOA knee vs. knee iOA (i.e. knee OA without evidence of previous knee injury) Time to event (knee PTOA/OA) among knee injured individuals ALLPTOA knee vs. knee injured individuals without OA (on sufficient follow up) 4A) ALLPTOA knee vs. injury free, OA free controls (over age 40) 4B) All knee injured individuals vs. injury free, OA free controls 4C) Knee iOA vs. injury free, OA free controls 23,368 ALLPTOA knee cases were identified across the 6 cohorts. Of these, 8936 (38%) were TE PTOA and 14572 (62%) were CC PTOA. 164,297 iOA knee and 24,086 knee injured, no OA comparators were identified. Sample size weighted means by phenotype across 5/6 cohorts were, % Males: 49 (ALLPTOA), 43 (Knee iOA), 54 (Knee Injured, OA free) and 47 (Injury free, OA free); and Age at diagnosis, years: 40 (knee injury), 51 (PTOA), 60 (iOA). UKB data were used to predict power for a variant with minor allele frequency of 0.3 for various effect sizes. Power curves were produced for a time-to-event GWAS (Figure 1A) or case comparator GWAS (Figure 1B). For a time to event analysis, 9500 knee injured cases would be required to detect variants with a moderate hazard ratio of 1.2, 80% power, at genome-wide significance (Analysis 2). Alternatively, comparing PTOA with iOA (or other comparators in excess), odds ratios of >1.15 could be detected at genome-wide significance with 4900 PTOA cases or more (Analyses 1,3,4). Conclusions: We report the methods development for the first GWAS meta-analysis of PTOA of the knee. Based on feasibility assessments and power calculations, sample numbers for a meta-analysis for primary analyses 1 and 3 will be exceeded. Though a time-to-event approach was methodologically attractive, available sample size is currently below what is needed. Differences in sex and age between phenotypes indicate these factors should be covariates. These findings underpin the analysis plan for our future work. Better understanding of molecular determinants of PTOA will enable its prediction, stratification and prevention.

However, no previous studies have proven whether JB can be regarded as a targeted drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the anti-RA effects of JB and explore the potential mechanisms. Methods: Components and targets of JB and RA were identified in different databases, and potential targets and pathways were predicted by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. Then, molecular docking and surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) were used to confirm the predict. The anti-arthritic effects of JB were studied in vivo with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model and in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage. Potential mechanisms were further verified by in vivo and in vitro experiments. Results: The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that Th17 cell differentiation, prolactin signaling pathway, and JAK/STAT signaling pathway might be associated with anti-RA effects of JB. Molecular docking and SPR results showed that JB bound effectively to JAK2. JB significantly decreased body weight loss, arthritis index, paw thickness, and synovial thickness in CIA rats. Histomorphological results suggested the protective effects of JB on CIA rats with ankle joint injury. Molecular biology analysis indicated that JB suppressed the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors in ankle joints for CIA rats and reduced the concentration of these factors in LPS- induced RAW264.7 macrophage. The protein expression level of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was also significantly decreased by JB. Conclusion: JB had a novel inhibitory effect on inflammation and bone destruction in CIA rats, and the mechanism might be related to the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.","

It is well understood as a vasospastic condition affecting the acral and digital arteries, resulting in characteristic, well-demarcated color changes typically in the hands and feet in response to cold or stress. Secondary RP (SRP) has been described in association with a variety of rheumatologic and nonrheumatologic diseases, environmental exposures, and/or medications. While both primary RP and SRP may impact the quality of life, SRP may lead to permanent and potentially devastating tissue destruction when undiagnosed and untreated. It is therefore crucial for dermatologists to distinguish between primary and secondary disease forms early in clinical evaluation, investigate potential underlying causes, and risk stratify SRP patients for the development of associated autoimmune connective tissue disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of both forms of RP are described in detail in this review article.","

AB  - Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a relatively common disease with both primary and secondary forms. It is well understood as a vasospastic condition affecting the acral and digital arteries, resulting in characteristic, well-demarcated color changes typically in the hands and feet in response to cold or stress. Secondary RP (SRP) has been described in association with a variety of rheumatologic and nonrheumatologic diseases, environmental exposures, and/or medications. While both primary RP and SRP may impact the quality of life, SRP may lead to permanent and potentially devastating tissue destruction when undiagnosed and untreated. It is therefore crucial for dermatologists to distinguish between primary and secondary disease forms early in clinical evaluation, investigate potential underlying causes, and risk stratify SRP patients for the development of associated autoimmune connective tissue disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of both forms of RP are described in detail in this review article.

These compounds promote health by alleviating the symptoms and illnesses associated with menopause and arthritis. Diosgenin (DSG) occurs naturally in plants such as Dioscorea villosa (DV) and binds to estrogen receptors, so it may have similar effects to this hormone, including against arthritis. Thus, we investigated the effect of chronic treatment with dry extract of DV and its phytoestrogen DSG on ovariectomized mice with arthritis. We found that dry extract of Dioscorea villosa (DV) contains the phytoestrogen diosgenin (DSG) in its composition. Furthermore, arthritic mice treated with DV and DSG showed reduced neutrophil accumulation in the articular cartilage. Also, the dry extract of DV administered orally (v.o) did not alter the leukocyte count in the joints or promote changes in the reproductive tract. However, DSG altered these parameters, with possible beneficial effects by reducing symptoms related to reproductive aging. Thus, oral treatment with dry extract of DV and subcutaneous (s.c) treatment with DSG showed promise by acting against inflammation caused by arthritis and reducing symptoms in the reproductive tract due to menopause.","

AB  - Humans are exposed to natural compounds such as phytoestrogens primarily through diet and supplements. These compounds promote health by alleviating the symptoms and illnesses associated with menopause and arthritis. Diosgenin (DSG) occurs naturally in plants such as Dioscorea villosa (DV) and binds to estrogen receptors, so it may have similar effects to this hormone, including against arthritis. Thus, we investigated the effect of chronic treatment with dry extract of DV and its phytoestrogen DSG on ovariectomized mice with arthritis. We found that dry extract of Dioscorea villosa (DV) contains the phytoestrogen diosgenin (DSG) in its composition. Furthermore, arthritic mice treated with DV and DSG showed reduced neutrophil accumulation in the articular cartilage. Also, the dry extract of DV administered orally (v.o) did not alter the leukocyte count in the joints or promote changes in the reproductive tract. However, DSG altered these parameters, with possible beneficial effects by reducing symptoms related to reproductive aging. Thus, oral treatment with dry extract of DV and subcutaneous (s.c) treatment with DSG showed promise by acting against inflammation caused by arthritis and reducing symptoms in the reproductive tract due to menopause.

Methods: We conducted a literature search for (review) articles that discussed the health benefits of combined oral contraceptives (COCs), in the period from 1980 to 2023. Results: We identified 21 subjective and/or objective health benefits of COCs related to (i) the reproductive tract, (ii) non-gynaecological benign disorders and (iii) malignancies. Reproductive tract benefits are related to menstrual bleeding(including anaemia and toxic shock syndrome), dysmenorrhoea, migraine, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), ovarian cysts, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), androgen related symptoms, ectopic pregnancy, hypoestrogenism, endometriosis and adenomyosis, uterine fibroids and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Research design and methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of a medical claims dataset over a 10 year span was conducted in patients aged 60 years or older. Participants were propensity score matched for comorbidity severity and demographic parameters. Relative risk (RR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined for age-related NDDs. Cumulative hazard ratios and treatment duration were determined to assess the association between CNS-active drugs and NDDs at different ages and treatment duration intervals. Results: In 309,128 patients who met inclusion criteria, exposure to CNS-active drugs was associated with a decreased risk of AD (0.86% vs 1.73%, RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.47-0.53; p <.0001) and all NDDs (3.13% vs 5.76%, RR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.53-0.56; p <.0001). Analysis of impact of drug class on risk of AD indicated that antidepressant, sedative, anticonvulsant, and stimulant medications were associated with significantly reduced risk of AD whereas atypical antipsychotics were associated with increased AD risk. The greatest risk reduction for AD and NDDs occurred in patients aged 70 years or older with a protective effect only in patients with long-term therapy (>3 years). Furthermore, responders to these therapeutics were characterized by diagnosed obesity and higher prescriptions of anti-inflammatory drugs and menopausal hormonal therapy, compared to patients with a diagnosis of AD (non-responders). Addition of a second CNS-active drug was associated with greater reduction in AD risk compared to monotherapy, with the combination of a Z-drug and an SNRI associated with greatest AD risk reduction. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings indicate that CNS-active drugs were associated with reduced risk of developing AD and other age-related NDDs. The exception was atypical antipsychotics, which increased risk. Potential use of combination therapy with atypical antipsychotics could mitigate the risk conferred by these drugs. Evidence from these analyses advance precision prevention strategies to reduce the risk of age-related NDDs in persons with neuropsychiatric disorders.","

Methods: The entire PubMed/Medline database was screened following the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies describing PG that have occurred after reduction mammoplasty. Results: Twenty-eight articles including 31 patients reported a PG after breast reduction surgery between January 1988 and March 2022. Twenty-one (68%) patients presented with skin ulcerations, 14 (45%) with erythema, and 5 (16%) with vesicles. Out of the 30 cases that underwent bilateral surgery, 18 (60%) developed PG bilaterally. In 12 out of 31 patients, nipple–areolar complex (NAC) involvement was evaluated, though in 10 patients (83%) the NAC was spared. Of the 20 patients (65%) who underwent skin biopsies for histopathological examination, 18 (90%) showed neutrophilic infiltration of the dermal layers. All 31 patients (100%) showed rapid clinical improvement after the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy.

Exposure was defined using the critical period during pregnancy for each type of harmful drug: preconceptional period or first trimester for teratogenic drugs and second or third trimesters for fetotoxic drugs. Main outcome measures Prevalence of pregnancies exposed to at least one harmful drug. Results Among 5,253,284 pregnancies, 204,402 (389 per 10,000) pregnancies were exposed to at least one harmful drug during the critical periods: 48,326 (92 per 10,000) pregnancies were exposed to teratogenic drugs during the preconceptional period or the first trimester, and 155,514 (299 per 10,000) pregnancies were exposed to fetotoxic drugs during the second or third trimesters. Teratogenic drugs were mainly retinoids for topical use (44 per 10,000 pregnancies), antiepileptics (13 per 10,000 pregnancies) and statins (13 per 10,000 pregnancies). Fetotoxic drugs were mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for systemic (128 per 10,000 pregnancies) and topical use (122 per 10,000 pregnancies). Exposure to teratogenic drugs decreased from the preconceptional period to the first trimester. Exposure to fetotoxic drugs decreased from the second to the third trimester. Between 2013 and 2019, we found a decrease in harmful drug exposure overall, mainly for topical and systemic NSAIDs and for topical retinoids. Conclusions In this nationwide study, about one in 25 pregnancies was exposed to at least one harmful drug, mainly NSAIDs and topical retinoids. Although the prevalence of harmful drug exposure decreased over the study period, NSAID exposure in the second and third trimester remains of concern.","

AB  - Objective Describe the trends of exposure to harmful drugs during pregnancy over recent years in France. Design Nationwide cohort study. Setting The French National administrative health Data System (SNDS). Population Pregnancies starting between 2013 and 2019 and outcomes corresponding to live births, medical terminations of pregnancy, and stillbirths. Methods Each pregnancy was divided into a preconceptional period of 90 days before conception and three trimesters from conception to birth. Harmful drugs were defined according to their risks to the fetus: teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. Exposure was defined using the critical period during pregnancy for each type of harmful drug: preconceptional period or first trimester for teratogenic drugs and second or third trimesters for fetotoxic drugs. Main outcome measures Prevalence of pregnancies exposed to at least one harmful drug.

Synovial inflammation and synovial pannus are crucial in the onset of RA. The “tumor-like” invading proliferation of new arteries is a keynote of RA. Commiphora wightii (C wightii) is a perennial, deciduous, and trifoliate plant used in several areas of southeast Asia to cure numerous ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and asthma. Several in vitro investigations have indicated C wightii’s therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of arthritis. However, the precise molecular action is yet unknown. Material and methods: In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to uncover potential targets, active therapeutic ingredients and signaling pathways in C wightii for the treatment of arthritis. In the groundwork of this research, we examined the active constituent-compound-target-pathway network and evaluated that (Guggulsterol-V, Myrrhahnone B, and Campesterol) decisively donated to the development of arthritis by affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), PIK3CA, and MAPK3 genes. Later on, docking was employed to confirm the active components’ efficiency against the potential targets. Results: According to molecular-docking research, several potential targets of RA bind tightly with the corresponding key active ingredient of C wightii. With the aid of network pharmacology techniques, we conclude that the signaling pathways and biological processes involved in C wightii had an impact on the prevention of arthritis. The outcomes of molecular docking also serve as strong recommendations for future research. In the context of this study, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking analysis showed that C wightii acted on arthritis-related signaling pathways to exhibit a promising preventive impact on arthritis. Conclusion: These results serve as the basis for grasping the mechanism of the antiarthritis activity of C wightii. However, further in vivo/in vitro study is needed to verify the reliability of these targets for the treatment of arthritis.","

AB  - We report the history of a woman who developed four intracranial meningiomas during 11 years of therapy with the synthetic progesterone agonist megestrol. After discontinuation of the drug at age 75 years, she improved clinically and a CT scan showed near complete regression of the meningiomas by 78 years. Autopsy was performed at 83 years of age following an accidental death. At the tumor sites, we found both collagenous tissue with small islands of low grade meningioma having strong nuclear immunoreactivity for progesterone receptor and lipomatous tissue. A literature review showed similar cases of radiologic meningioma regression following discontinuance of progestins. Our case is the first one with histopathologic characterization of the end point.

However, the safety of ICSI has been questioned and a relatively high risk for septic arthritis, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPIO) and periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) in patients undergoing subsequent total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been suggested. Methods: This is a retrospective evaluation of 682 hips that underwent ICSI with 40 mg of Triamcinolone for primary osteoarthritis of the hip. All ICSI were performed using sterile techniques, the number of ICSI in each hip and the cumulative corticosteroid dosage were assessed. Pre- and post-injection radiographs were compared to identify cases with RPIO. Native joint septic arthritis, surgical site infections and PJI were identified by chart review. Results: 4 hips (0.6%) developed RPIO 2–4 months following ICSI. The cumulative Triamcinolone dose was not associated with the development of RPIO (p = 0.281). 1 case was diagnosed with septic arthritis and treated with staged THA, there were no signs of infection at a 5 years follow-up. 483 hips (75.7%) underwent THA, including 199 hips with THA less than 3 months following ICSI and 181 hips with > 1 ICSI prior to THA. There were 3 superficial surgical site infections/wound dehiscence and no PJI. Conclusion: The rate of RPIO was 0.6%. The current findings suggest that if ICSI is performed under sterile conditions, the risk for septic arthritis or PJI following THA, even in patients with multiple ICSI or ICSI within 3 months prior to surgery, is minimal.","

This study aims to examine the physical and mental health perceptions in BC patients enrolled in an international, multi-center REQUITE study. Materials/Methods: This study includes 2,057 patients with ER+ early-stage BC treated with breast conservation surgery, radiation (RT), and endocrine therapy (ET) across Europe and North America between April 2014 and March 2017. The prospectively collected HRQoL dataset includes EORTC30 and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) at baseline, post-RT, 1, 2, and 3 years of follow up. Patients were stratified by age: 851 aged <70 (younger) and 201 aged ≥ 70 (older). The median age (range) for the younger and older cohort is 57 years (30-69 years) and 75 years (70-86 years), respectively. Analysis includes descriptive statistics and univariable logistic regression. Results: Older patients had a greater burden of comorbid conditions including increased BMI (27.3 vs 26.5; P = 0.006), history of diabetes (10.9% vs 6.6%; P = 0.0336), heart disease (15.4% vs 6.1%; P<0.0001), rheumatoid arthritis (6.5% vs 3.2%; P = 0.0280), hypertension (54.2% vs 25.0%; P<0.0001), and polypharmacy (37.8% vs 16.7%; P<0.0001) compared to younger patients. Higher utilization of aromatase inhibitor (67.7% vs 42.4%; P<0.0001) in older patients, and tamoxifen (63.7% vs 36.5%; P<0.0001) in younger patients. The T-stage distribution in younger and older patients is T1 = 82.4% vs 68.7%, T2 = 9.8% vs 26.4%, T3 = 0.1% vs 1%, respectively. The 3-year relapse-free survival was similar in both groups (P = 0.183). Significant worsening in fatigue (P<0.0001, P<0.0001), pain (P = 0.0274, P<0.0001), cognitive functioning (P = 0.0291, P<0.0001), and global health status (P = 0.0064, P<0.0001) was observed during follow up from baseline in both groups (older patients, younger patients). Compared to older patients where significant deterioration persisted, younger patients showed improvement in most HRQoL measures over the duration of follow up years. Older patients had poorer global health status (OR = 1.19 vs 0.8, P = 0.0214) than younger patients from baseline at 2 years. On the MFI-20 measure, both age groups showed worsening fatigue from baseline at post-RT, but eventual recovery noted in the 1-to-3-year follow up period. Conclusion: Older patients, present with greater comorbidities, polypharmacy, and later stages in BC, reported worsening fatigue, pain, cognitive functioning, and global health status during 3 years follow up. One limitation of this study is that patients were predominately White, potentially limiting the generalizability of these observations. Further studies supplementing biomarkers and prognostic signatures with functional measures such as HRQoL may provide a useful tool to guide risk-tailored treatment in older patients with breast cancer.","

Objective: Dermatologic care is an important component of the multidisciplinary care needed for individuals with DSD. This article discusses the most common primary dermatologic manifestations of DSD in addition to the cutaneous manifestations of hormonal and surgical therapies in individuals with DSD. Data sources: Published articles including case series and case reports on PubMed. Study selections: Selection was conducted by examining existing literature with a team of multidisciplinary specialists. Methods: Narrative review. Limitations: This article was not conducted as a systematic review. Results: In Klinefelter syndrome, refractory leg ulcers and incontinentia pigmenti have been described. Turner syndrome is associated with lymphatic malformations, halo nevi, dermatitis, and psoriasis. Virilization can be seen in some forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, where acne and hirsutism are common. Conclusion: Dermatologists should consider teratogenic risk for treatments of skin conditions in DSD depending on pregnancy potential. Testosterone replacement, commonly used for Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5-alpha reductase deficiency, gonadal dysgenesis, or ovotesticular DSD, may cause acne.","

AB  - Differences of sex development (DSD or disorders of sex development) are uncommon congenital conditions, characterized by atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex. Objective: Dermatologic care is an important component of the multidisciplinary care needed for individuals with DSD. This article discusses the most common primary dermatologic manifestations of DSD in addition to the cutaneous manifestations of hormonal and surgical therapies in individuals with DSD. Data sources: Published articles including case series and case reports on PubMed. Study selections: Selection was conducted by examining existing literature with a team of multidisciplinary specialists. Methods: Narrative review. Limitations: This article was not conducted as a systematic review. Results: In Klinefelter syndrome, refractory leg ulcers and incontinentia pigmenti have been described. Turner syndrome is associated with lymphatic malformations, halo nevi, dermatitis, and psoriasis. Virilization can be seen in some forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, where acne and hirsutism are common. Conclusion: Dermatologists should consider teratogenic risk for treatments of skin conditions in DSD depending on pregnancy potential. Testosterone replacement, commonly used for Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5-alpha reductase deficiency, gonadal dysgenesis, or ovotesticular DSD, may cause acne.

Despite the increasing use of these agents, their adverse drug-related events have not yet been fully characterized. We describe the spectrum of cutaneous adverse reactions occurring in advanced breast cancer patients treated with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, analyzing types, severity, time to onset, and possible treatment outcomes. Methods: We performed a multicentric retrospective study including patients with advanced breast cancer who developed cutaneous lesions during treatment with CDK4/6i in the period from June 2020 to June 2021. Patients > 18 years were recruited at eleven onco-dermatology units located in Albania (1), Argentina (1), France (1), Greece (3), Italy (3), and Spain (2). We evaluated patients’ epidemiological and clinical characteristics, types of cutaneous adverse events, their time to onset, and treatment outcomes. The severity of the skin reactions was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 score. Results: Seventy-nine patients (median age: 62.3 years; range 39–83 years) were included in the study, and, collectively, we recorded a total of 165 cutaneous adverse events during follow-up visits. The most frequent cutaneous reactions were pruritus (49/79 patients), alopecia (25/79), and eczematous lesions (24/79). Cutaneous toxicities were usually mild in severity (>65%) and occurred after a median of 6.5 months. Only four patients (5%) required treatment discontinuation due to the severity of the skin lesions. The majority of the skin reactions were managed with topical treatments. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we present the largest case series of cutaneous adverse events developing in advanced breast cancer patients treated with CDK4/6i. We showed that cutaneous toxicities are usually mild in severity, and manageable with standard supportive care; however, in selected cases, they can lead to treatment discontinuation with possible implications for patients’ clinical outcomes.","

Even though postmenopausal osteoporosis is the most common type, 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 years will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime and secondary osteoporosis is more common in men, estimated to occur in between 50 and 80%. Our national osteoporosis guideline group in the UK (NOGG) only considers a small number of specific conditions as secondary causes for osteoporosis including glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking and alcohol. Whilst NOGG recommends using a FRAX adjustment of + 20% and + 15% for hip and major osteoporotic fracture risk, respectively, for patients aged>50 years receiving>7.5 mg prednisolone per day, no such guidance exists for other 2ndary causes of osteoporosis, such as male hypogonadism and an adjustment of FRAX taking other causes into consideration has been recommended. It has been estimated that detailed laboratory evaluation of men thought to suffer with primary osteoporosis unmasked a specific underlying cause in almost half of the patients, with 24% secondary to male hypogonadism. Serum testosterone levels decrease by 1% annually with age in elderly men and consequently the incidence of hypogonadism increases with age, with a prevalence of up to 50% in those over 80 years of age. Androgen receptors are present in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Directly or indirectly through estrogens, androgens help preserve trabecular bone by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Studies in mouse models suggest that testosterone stimulates androgen receptors on osteoblasts promoting trabecular bone formation, and selective inactivation of the androgen receptor in osteocytes accelerated age related deterioration of skeletal health, findings supporting a role of androgens in maintaining trabecular bone health via stimulation of androgen receptors in osteocytes. However, estrogen deficiency in hypogonadal men is believed to be the primary hormone deficiency responsible for bone loss. Finkelstein et al. showed that estrogen deficiency as a result of aromatase inhibition in young men on gonadal suppressive therapy led to significant bone losses and raised bone markers independent of testosterone levels. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, and increasingly sophisticated treatments have resulted in an increasing prevalence of prostate cancer survivors. Hormone ablation therapy (HAT) or androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the preferred modality in prostate cancer treatment. ADT has a systemic effect on bone and is associated with significant bone loss, microarchitectural deterioration, and increased risk of fracture. A Swedish cohort study reported an increased risk of any fracture, hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture compared with controls, or men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT. There is increasing evidence that antiresorptive treatment in men with prostate cancer on androgen depletion therapy is effective in reducing vertebral fractures and improving BMD, yet surprisingly a recent Australian study confirmed that less than 20% of man underwent DXA scanning between 6 months before and 12 months after commencing ADT.","

It has been estimated that detailed laboratory evaluation of men thought to suffer with primary osteoporosis unmasked a specific underlying cause in almost half of the patients, with 24% secondary to male hypogonadism. Serum testosterone levels decrease by 1% annually with age in elderly men and consequently the incidence of hypogonadism increases with age, with a prevalence of up to 50% in those over 80 years of age. Androgen receptors are present in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Directly or indirectly through estrogens, androgens help preserve trabecular bone by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Studies in mouse models suggest that testosterone stimulates androgen receptors on osteoblasts promoting trabecular bone formation, and selective inactivation of the androgen receptor in osteocytes accelerated age related deterioration of skeletal health, findings supporting a role of androgens in maintaining trabecular bone health via stimulation of androgen receptors in osteocytes. However, estrogen deficiency in hypogonadal men is believed to be the primary hormone deficiency responsible for bone loss. Finkelstein et al. showed that estrogen deficiency as a result of aromatase inhibition in young men on gonadal suppressive therapy led to significant bone losses and raised bone markers independent of testosterone levels. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, and increasingly sophisticated treatments have resulted in an increasing prevalence of prostate cancer survivors. Hormone ablation therapy (HAT) or androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the preferred modality in prostate cancer treatment. ADT has a systemic effect on bone and is associated with significant bone loss, microarchitectural deterioration, and increased risk of fracture. A Swedish cohort study reported an increased risk of any fracture, hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture compared with controls, or men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT. There is increasing evidence that antiresorptive treatment in men with prostate cancer on androgen depletion therapy is effective in reducing vertebral fractures and improving BMD, yet surprisingly a recent Australian study confirmed that less than 20% of man underwent DXA scanning between 6 months before and 12 months after commencing ADT.

Indeed, most of the anti-TNFs information product do not list menstrual disorders as possible side effects. Moreover, only few cases have been previously published with adalimumab [1-3]. Material and methods: Here we present a case of adalimumab-induced menstrual bleeding recurring with etanercept. Results: A 44-year-old woman started adalimumab on early December 2021 for HLA-B27 positive psoriasis and spondyloarthritis resistant to anti-inflammatory drugs. Rapidly, she suffered from permanent gynecological heavy bleeding. She discontinued the anti-TNF after one month and half, and finally recovered within 15 days. Three months later, she started etanercept. As menorrhagia recurred, she finally stopped the drug after two months, which led to gynecological improvement. Her clinician definitely banished anti-TNFs and prescribed an anti-IL-23 (guselkumab). No more menorrhagia occurred after several months of treatment. Discussion/Conclusion: As far as we know, four cases of anti-TNF-induced menorrhagia were reported in the literature from 2008 to 2012, exclusively with adalimumab [1-3]. All women totally recovered following estrogen therapy and only one continued the biotherapy. Authors did not evoke any positive rechallenge with another anti-TNF. Thus, our case seems to be the first with such situation, suggesting a class effect. Moreover, our query in the worldwide pharmacovigilance database showed few thousands of uterine bleeding disorders with this class (HLGT: menstruation cycle and uterine bleeding disorders; adalimumab: 56%; etanercept: 36%). Interestingly, the current information product of certolizumab is the only one bearing the mention menstrual cycle and uterine bleeding disorders [4]. No more is the case for adalimumab since 2009 following a Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) opinion [5]. However, based on new data, another assessment is currently performed for all anti-TNFs. Results are expected in February 2023. Meanwhile, physicians should be aware of menstrual bleeding as possible adverse effect with anti- TNFs.","

As women transition through menopause, the effects of decreasing endogenous estrogen production on the vaginal environment have a significant impact on VVC infections in these women. In this review, we discuss the protective mechanism of menopause against VVC and risk factors for postmenopausal women in developing VVC, as well as the presentation and treatment of the infection in postmenopausal patients. Recent Findings: The odds of developing VVC have found to decrease by 7% with each year of age after 57, as predicted by the low glycogen levels occurring in postmenopausal women. However, certain medications and comorbidities such as tamoxifen, antibiotics, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SLGT-2) inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and immunosuppressants have been found to increase the prevalence of VVC in the postmenopausal population. Summary: Unfortunately, there is still a paucity of literature on the prevalence, risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment, and recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in postmenopausal women. Due to the fact that the vaginal environment, comorbidities, and Candida species are different in this population, the disease is often missed. Future research on VVC should include analysis of postmenopausal women such that providers can confidently educate and treat this specific population.","

AB  - Gut microbiome (GM) forms an integral part of homeostasis of an individual. Due to the recent development of metagenomics, the plausibility of sequencing GM and its therapeutic ability for various diseases has been explored. Dysbiosis or disequilibrium or pertubations of GM leads to disruption of intercommunication signaling among gut-bone axis, gut-bone-brain axis, and gut-disc axis resulting in the progression of various chronic diseases. The therapeutic interventions to restore the GM like prebiotics and probiotics, bacteriophage therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, and physical biomodulation have been identified. This review throw the lime light on the effect of gut dysbiosis in musculoskeletal diseases.

Here, we examined the effects of female sex hormones, particularly oestrogen, on psoriasis-like dermatitis induced using topical imiquimod in mice that underwent either sham operation (Sham) or ovariectomy (OVX), with (hormone replacement treatment: HRT) or without 17β-oestradiol targeting the maximum physiological levels. The number of neutrophils in the skin was higher in the order of OVX-, Sham-, and HRT-treated mice. However, no significant difference was detected in the clinical scores among the three groups due to severe erythema and scale in a few mice out of HRT-treated mice in a set of experiments. OVX- and HRT-treated mice showed increased mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-23 compared with Sham-treated mice; increased IL-10 mRNA levels were found in HRT-treated mice, possibly due to an increased proportion of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)- and IL-10 positive large cells (possibly macrophages). In addition, HRT-treated mice had a more compact stratum corneum with higher expression of loricrin and involucrin than OVX- and Sham-treated mice. This study suggests that oestrogen has a dual potential in the pathogenesis of psoriasis: suppression of inflammation by enhancing IL-10 production and enhancement of inflammation by induction of IL-22 and IL-23 expression.","

AB  - Sex hormones influence the development and natural course of psoriasis. Here, we examined the effects of female sex hormones, particularly oestrogen, on psoriasis-like dermatitis induced using topical imiquimod in mice that underwent either sham operation (Sham) or ovariectomy (OVX), with (hormone replacement treatment: HRT) or without 17β-oestradiol targeting the maximum physiological levels. The number of neutrophils in the skin was higher in the order of OVX-, Sham-, and HRT-treated mice. However, no significant difference was detected in the clinical scores among the three groups due to severe erythema and scale in a few mice out of HRT-treated mice in a set of experiments. OVX- and HRT-treated mice showed increased mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-23 compared with Sham-treated mice; increased IL-10 mRNA levels were found in HRT-treated mice, possibly due to an increased proportion of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)- and IL-10 positive large cells (possibly macrophages). In addition, HRT-treated mice had a more compact stratum corneum with higher expression of loricrin and involucrin than OVX- and Sham-treated mice. This study suggests that oestrogen has a dual potential in the pathogenesis of psoriasis: suppression of inflammation by enhancing IL-10 production and enhancement of inflammation by induction of IL-22 and IL-23 expression.

Sex is well known to influence risk, severity and treatment outcomes of RA, although the underlying causes are uncertain. The aim of this research was to examine whether factors influencing female sex hormones (reproductive status and exogenous sex hormone use) are associated with the efficacy of DMARDs. Methods. Individual participant data were pooled from five phase 3 clinical trials where RA patients were treated with tocilizumab and/or conventional synthetic DMARDs. The primary outcome was the time to first remission according to the Simplified Disease Activity Index. The relationship between menopausal status or use of exogenous sex hormones and the time of first remission was assessed via Cox proportional analysis. Analysed data included sex, baseline menopausal status (premenopausal, perimenopausal, early postmenopausal and postmenopausal), participant age, body mass index, race, number of previous DMARDs and baseline disease activity. Results. Analysis included 4474 female patients, of whom 2817 (62.9%) were postmenopausal, 202 (4.5%) were early postmenopausal, 1021 (22.8%) were premenopausal and 414 (9.2%) were perimenopausal. Of these, 221 (7.8%), 13 (6.4%), 255 (25%) and 47 (11.4%), respectively, were taking exogenous sex hormones. In the pooled analysis, perimenopausal status was associated with reduced remission compared with premenopausal status [adjusted HR 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99)]. Sex hormone use was associated with significantly higher remission [adjusted HR 1.20 (95% CI 1.01, 1.43)]. Conclusion. Perimenopausal women were less likely to achieve remission compared with premenopausal RA patients. The use of exogenous sex hormones appeared to be associated with more frequent remission in female RA patients, particularly those who were perimenopausal and early postmenopausal, although further research is required to confirm and identify the drivers for this observation and how it interacts with menopausal status.","

The clinical manifestation of HAE type 2 can be triggered by both specific and nonspecific factors. The symptoms may vary but usually involve angioedema of limbs and face. The attacks can be life-threatening especially because the treatment used in allergic histamine-dependent angioedema is not effective in bradykinin-dependent HAE type 2. Case report: A 30-year- old woman in good general condition was admitted to the hospital with swollen joints and nonspecific skin lesions on her wrists, palms, and around mammary papillae. Initially, rheumatoid arthritis was suggested, though the diagnosis was ruled out and with symptoms receeding the patient was discharged from the hospital. Just before hospitalization, the patient had started taking ethinylestradiolum and levonorgestrelum combined contraceptive pills as a treatment for uterine fibroid. In the following months, the patient experienced recurring angioedema of limbs and recurrent stomach pain. 5 months later, symptoms became more severe and face angioedema was also accompanied by problems with swallowing. The patient had taken a high dose of antihistamine and steroids at home, followed by adrenaline administration in the Emergency Department. Eventually, her condition started to gradually improve although unlikely due to the applied treatment. With normal C1 inhibitor serum concentration and its low activity, the final diagnosis was HAE type 2. The patient was given a recombinant C1 inhibitor and bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist as a treatment. Later, globules with estriol were used for vaginal infection, though they also induced symptoms of HAE type 2. All in all, the reduction of dose of hormones improved the symptoms significantly, the treatment of uterine fibroid still remains unsolved as hysterectomy is not a reasonable option for a patient that young. Conclusion: Clinical manifestations of HAE type 2 were triggered by estrogen administration. Due to the mild form of the disease, the patient did not experience symptoms before the introduction of contraceptive pills. The case shows that avoidance of estrogens in various medications should be kept in mind.","

Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women,"['calcium', 'calcium carbonate', 'calcium plus colecalciferol', 'colecalciferol', 'ergocalciferol', 'estrogen receptor', 'placebo', 'strontium ranelate', 'trace element', 'vitamin D', 'adult', 'article', 'body mass', 'bone density', 'calcium blood level', 'diet supplementation', 'female', 'fibromyalgia', 'fracture', 'hip fracture', 'human', 'menstrual cycle', 'musculoskeletal disease', 'osteoarthritis', 'osteopenia', 'osteoporosis', 'premenopause', 'randomized controlled trial (topic)', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'supplementation', 'systemic lupus erythematosus', 'vitamin D deficiency']","Background: Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life. Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo. Search methods: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non-vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason. Main results: We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. Calcium versus placebo. Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) −0.04 g/cm2, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.11 to 0.03; I2 = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm2, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.06; I2 = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low-certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D versus placebo. Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (−0.03, 95% CI −0.06 to 0; moderate-certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I2 = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral). The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.","

Post-stroke neuroinflammation has recently received increasing attention with the aim of providing a new effective treatment strategy for ischemic stroke. Microglia and astrocytes are major components of the innate immune system of the central nervous system. They can be involved in all phases of ischemic stroke, from the early stage, contributing to the first wave of neuronal cell death, to the late stage involving phagocytosis and repair. In the early stage of ischemic stroke, a vicious cycle exists between the activation of microglia and astrocytes (through astrocytic connexin 43 hemichannels), aggravating neuroinflammatory injury post-stroke. However, in the late stage of ischemic stroke, repeat-edly activated microglia can induce the formation of glial scars by triggering reactive astrogliosis in the peri-infarct regions, which may limit the movement of activated microglia in reverse and restrict the diffusion of inflammation to healthy brain tissues, alleviating the neuroinflammatory injury post-stroke. In this review, we elucidated the various roles of astrocytes and microglia and summarized their relationship with neuroinflammation. We also examined how astrocytes and microglia influence each other at different stages of ischemic stroke. Several potential therapeutic approaches targeting astrocytes and microglia in ischemic stroke have been reviewed. Understanding the details of astrocyte-microglia interaction processes will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke, contributing to the identification of new therapeutic interventions.","

AB  - Ischemic stroke is the predominant cause of severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. Post-stroke neuroinflammation has recently received increasing attention with the aim of providing a new effective treatment strategy for ischemic stroke. Microglia and astrocytes are major components of the innate immune system of the central nervous system. They can be involved in all phases of ischemic stroke, from the early stage, contributing to the first wave of neuronal cell death, to the late stage involving phagocytosis and repair. In the early stage of ischemic stroke, a vicious cycle exists between the activation of microglia and astrocytes (through astrocytic connexin 43 hemichannels), aggravating neuroinflammatory injury post-stroke. However, in the late stage of ischemic stroke, repeat-edly activated microglia can induce the formation of glial scars by triggering reactive astrogliosis in the peri-infarct regions, which may limit the movement of activated microglia in reverse and restrict the diffusion of inflammation to healthy brain tissues, alleviating the neuroinflammatory injury post-stroke. In this review, we elucidated the various roles of astrocytes and microglia and summarized their relationship with neuroinflammation. We also examined how astrocytes and microglia influence each other at different stages of ischemic stroke. Several potential therapeutic approaches targeting astrocytes and microglia in ischemic stroke have been reviewed. Understanding the details of astrocyte-microglia interaction processes will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke, contributing to the identification of new therapeutic interventions.

SCAD is caused by separation occurring within or between any of the three tunics of the coronary artery wall. This leads to intramural hematoma and/or formation of false lumen in the artery, which leads to ischemic changes or infarction of the myocardium. The incidence of SCAD is higher in women than in men, with a ratio of approximately 9:1. It is estimated that SCAD is responsible for 35% of ACS cases in women under the age of 60. The high frequency is particularly observed during pregnancy and in the peripartum period (first week). Traditional risk factors are rare in patients with SCAD, except for hypertension. Patients diagnosed with SCAD have different combinations of risk factors compared with patients who have atherosclerotic changes in their coronary arteries. We presented the most common so-called “non-traditional” risk factors associated with SCAD patients. Risk factors and precipitating disorders which are associated with SCAD: In the literature, there are few diseases frequently associated with SCAD, and they are identified as predisposing factors. The predominant cause is fibromuscular dysplasia, followed by inherited connective tissue disorders, systemic inflammatory diseases, pregnancy, use of sex hormones or steroids, use of cocaine or amphetamines, thyroid disorders, migraine, and tinnitus. In recent years, the genetic predisposition for SCAD is also recognized as a predisposing factor. The precipitating factors are also different in women (emotional stress) compared with those in men (physical stress). Women experiencing SCAD frequently describe symptoms of anxiety and depression. These conditions could increase shear stress on the arterial wall and dissection of the coronary artery wall. Despite the advancement of SCAD, we can find significant differences in the clinical presentation between women and men. Conclusion: When evaluating patients with chest pain or other ACS symptoms who have a low cardiovascular risk, particularly female patients, it is important to consider the possibility of ACS due to SCAD, particularly in conditions often associated with SCAD. This will increase the recognition of SCAD and the timely treatment of affected patients.","

AB  - Introduction: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) accounts for 1%–4% of cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). SCAD is caused by separation occurring within or between any of the three tunics of the coronary artery wall. This leads to intramural hematoma and/or formation of false lumen in the artery, which leads to ischemic changes or infarction of the myocardium. The incidence of SCAD is higher in women than in men, with a ratio of approximately 9:1. It is estimated that SCAD is responsible for 35% of ACS cases in women under the age of 60. The high frequency is particularly observed during pregnancy and in the peripartum period (first week). Traditional risk factors are rare in patients with SCAD, except for hypertension. Patients diagnosed with SCAD have different combinations of risk factors compared with patients who have atherosclerotic changes in their coronary arteries. We presented the most common so-called “non-traditional” risk factors associated with SCAD patients. Risk factors and precipitating disorders which are associated with SCAD: In the literature, there are few diseases frequently associated with SCAD, and they are identified as predisposing factors. The predominant cause is fibromuscular dysplasia, followed by inherited connective tissue disorders, systemic inflammatory diseases, pregnancy, use of sex hormones or steroids, use of cocaine or amphetamines, thyroid disorders, migraine, and tinnitus. In recent years, the genetic predisposition for SCAD is also recognized as a predisposing factor. The precipitating factors are also different in women (emotional stress) compared with those in men (physical stress). Women experiencing SCAD frequently describe symptoms of anxiety and depression. These conditions could increase shear stress on the arterial wall and dissection of the coronary artery wall. Despite the advancement of SCAD, we can find significant differences in the clinical presentation between women and men. Conclusion: When evaluating patients with chest pain or other ACS symptoms who have a low cardiovascular risk, particularly female patients, it is important to consider the possibility of ACS due to SCAD, particularly in conditions often associated with SCAD. This will increase the recognition of SCAD and the timely treatment of affected patients.

Cigarette smoking along with alcohol consumption, infection with human papilloma (Hpv) and the Epstein–Barr viruses, is one of the main risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. It can also contribute to virus-associated carcinogenesis and affect the clinical and prognostic features of the tumor. Continued smoking at diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a negative prognostic factor and contributes to reduced patient survival rates. Aim. To analyze the smoking status and the effect of etiopathogenesis on molecular and clinical features in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OpSCC). Materials and methods. In patients with OpSCC, the smoking status and the level of motivation to its cessation were clarified. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections from paraffin blocks from the ThermoScentific immunohistosteiner was performed using monoclonal antibodies to estrogen receptors α (ERα), programmed death-ligand 1 (pD-L1), Bcl-2, p53 and p16. The percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the stromal component of the tumor (hematoxylin and eosin staining) was also analyzed. Results. Of 113 patients with OpSCC, 80 % of patients were current smokers, including 75 % of patients with Hpv-positive tumor status. men with OpSCC were statistically significantly more likely to smoke than women (p = 0.001), as were men with Hpv-positive tumor (p = 0.015). Smoking patients were characterized by a larger size of the primary tumor (T3–4), including those with Hpv (p = 0.015). positive Hpv status of the tumor is associated with autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroiditis, psoriasis) (p <0.05). A high level of TILs is characteristic of smokers, including those with p16+-status (p <0.05), but not for all patients with this status. The positive expression of ERα is associated with p16+-status, and the latter is associated with the absence of p53 expression (p <0.05). During conservative therapy, tumor regression is associated with the primary tumor size T1–2, p16 + status, female sex, age less than 55 years, TILs level ≥57.5 %, pD-L1 expression levels on tumor cells ≥2.2 %, Bcl-2 ≥5 % and ERα ≥65 % (p <0.05). At the same time, quality of good predictive model for tumor regression showed a TILs level of ≥57.5 % (area under curve, AuC) 0.796; sensitivity 78.6 %; specificity 75 %) and ERα (AuC 0.725; sensitivity 65 %; specificity 83 %). The level of motivation to quit smoking ranged from 1 to 7 points according the 10-point motivation scale in 89 % of respondents. Only 10 patients were ready to quit smoking immediately (10 points on the motivation scale). Conclusion. molecular heterogeneity of OpSCC was revealed, including in the group of p16+-tumors. Correlation of clinical and molecular parameters with response to conservative therapy can be used in planning of primary therapy and earlier use of surgical treatment. The level of motivation to quit smoking in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck may be increased by drawing attention to the problem at each doctor’s appointment as well as by informing about how to quit smoking and therapeutic approaches. In unmotivated patients, the concept of reducing the harm of smoking can be used involving the replacement of cigarettes with electronic tobacco heating systems, eliminating the carcinogenic effect of its combustion products.","

PADs were initially characterized in rodent uteri and, since then, have been described in other female tissues including ovaries, breast, and the lactotrope and gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. In these tissues and cells, estrogen robustly stimulates PAD expression resulting in changes in levels over the course of the female reproductive cycle. The best-characterized targets for PADs are arginine residues in histone tails, which, when citrullinated, alter chromatin structure and gene expression. Methodological advances have allowed for the identification of tissue-specific citrullinomes, which reveal that PADs citrullinate a wide range of enzymes and structural proteins to alter cell function. In contrast to their important physiological roles, PADs and citrullinated proteins are also involved in several female-specific diseases including autoimmune disorders and reproductive cancers. Herein, we review current knowledge regarding PAD expression and function and highlight the role of protein citrullination in both normal female reproductive tissues and associated diseases.","

AB  - Citrullination, the post-translational modification of arginine residues, is catalyzed by the four catalytically active peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD or PADI) isozymes and alters charge to affect target protein structure and function. PADs were initially characterized in rodent uteri and, since then, have been described in other female tissues including ovaries, breast, and the lactotrope and gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. In these tissues and cells, estrogen robustly stimulates PAD expression resulting in changes in levels over the course of the female reproductive cycle. The best-characterized targets for PADs are arginine residues in histone tails, which, when citrullinated, alter chromatin structure and gene expression. Methodological advances have allowed for the identification of tissue-specific citrullinomes, which reveal that PADs citrullinate a wide range of enzymes and structural proteins to alter cell function. In contrast to their important physiological roles, PADs and citrullinated proteins are also involved in several female-specific diseases including autoimmune disorders and reproductive cancers. Herein, we review current knowledge regarding PAD expression and function and highlight the role of protein citrullination in both normal female reproductive tissues and associated diseases.

Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine if the anti-fracture efficacy of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) differed by baseline falls history or fracture risk probability as estimated by FRAX, in a combined analysis of the two Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. Methods: A total of 25,389 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years were randomized to receive MHT (n = 12,739) or matching placebo (n = 12,650). At baseline, questionnaires were used to collect information on falls history, within the last 12 months, and clinical risk factors.

The effect of baseline FRAX probability on efficacy was investigated in the whole cohort. Results: Over 4.3 ± 2.1 years (mean ± SD), MHT (vs. placebo) significantly reduced the risk of any clinical fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI, 0.65–0.78]), MOF (HR 0.60 [95% CI, 0.53–0.69]), and hip fracture (0.66 [95% CI, 0.45–0.96]). Treatment was effective in reducing the risk of any clinical fracture, MOF, and hip fracture in women regardless of baseline FRAX MOF probability, with no evidence of an interaction between MHT and FRAX (p > 0.30). Similarly, there was no interaction (p > 0.30) between MHT and prior falls. Conclusion: In the combined WHI trials, compared to placebo, MHT reduces fracture risk regardless of FRAX probability and falls history in postmenopausal women.","

Methods: E3N is an ongoing French prospective cohort of 98,995 women since 1990 aged 40–65 years at enrolment. Data on reproductive/hormonal factors and treatments were regularly recorded. Exposures were defined as follows: – reproductive span (in years) = duration from menarche to menopause; – total ovulatory years = reproductive span−(number of full-term pregnancies × 0.75 + number of miscarriages × 0.25 + total duration of breast feeding + total duration of oral contraception); – lifetime duration of hormonal exposure (in years) = reproductive span + total duration of menopausal hormonal therapy; – composite estrogen score (CES, range = 0–6): 1 point for each item: early menarche, high parity, history of hysterectomy, use of oral contraception, use of menopausal hormonal therapy and late menopause. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of incident RA were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time scale. Results: Among the 78,391 postmenopausal cohort women, 637 validated incident RA cases occurred. Lifetime durations of hormonal exposures were not associated with incident RA in postmenopausal women. High (CES = 4–6) versus low (CES = 0–1) estrogen exposure was inversely associated with the risk of RA: HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.2–0.8. Conclusion: In the E3N cohort, high lifetime estrogen exposure, that summarizes cumulative endogenous and exogenous exposures, was associated with a decreased risk of RA in postmenopausal women.","

This study aimed to investigate the causes of musculoskeletal pain, including RA, among breast cancer patients. Methods: This retrospective study included breast cancer patients experiencing new-onset arthralgia during cancer treatment along with age-and sex-matched controls without breast cancer, who were evaluated at the Rheumatologic clinic between 2004 and 2017. The causes of musculoskeletal pain were compared between breast cancer patients and controls. The effects of cancer treatment on arthralgia and factors associated with RA were examined. Results: A total of 146 breast cancer patients and 102 controls were included in the final analysis. The most common cause of arthralgia during breast cancer treatment was osteoarthritis (OA, 61.0%), followed by enthesopathy/tendinopathy (28.1%), which included tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Overall, 50.0% of 72 breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs) satisfied the criteria of AI-induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS). The mean symptom duration (i.e., the time between pain onset and evaluation by a rheumatologist) was shorter in breast cancer patients than in controls (7.0 ± 12.1 vs. 14.8 ± 24.9 months, respectively; p = 0.004). RA was diagnosed in 3 (2.1%) breast cancer patients and 3 (2.9%) controls. All breast cancer patients with RA had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 66.7 ± 25.0 mm/h), whereas those without RA had a normal ESR (20.4 ± 21.5 mm/h). Patients with breast cancer required more analgesics than the controls. Conclusion: OA and enthesopathy/tendinopathy are the most common causes of arthralgia in breast cancer patients, which may concurrently manifest as AIMSS. Patients with breast cancer did not have a higher prevalence of RA than those without breast cancer.","

The specific anti-inflammatory effects of P4 and its derivatives (progestins) can also include the inhibition of proliferative signaling pathways and the antagonistic action against estrogen receptor beta-mediated signaling as a proinflammatory and mitogenic factor. The anti-inflammatory action of P4 is accomplished through the participation of progesterone receptor (PR) chaperones HSP90, as well as immunophilins FKBP51 and FKBP52, which are the validated targets of clinically approved immunosuppressive drugs. The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of HSP90 inhibitors, tacrolimus and cyclosporine, are manifested, among other factors, due to their participation in the formation of an active ligand–receptor complex of P4 and their interaction with its constituent immunophilins. Pharmacological agents such as HSP90 inhibitors can restore the lost anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids and P4 in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. By regulating the activity of FKBP51 and FKBP52, it is possible to increase or decrease hormonal signaling, as well as restore it during the development of hormone resistance. The combined action of immunophilin suppressors with steroid hormones may be a promising strategy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including endometriosis, stress-related disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and miscarriages. Presumably, the hormone receptor- and immunophilin-targeted drugs may act synergistically, allowing for a lower dose of each.","

In mice, UVB exposure leads to increased food-seeking behavior, food intake and weight gain, with a sexual dimorphism towards males. In both mice and human males, increased appetite is correlated with elevated levels of circulating ghrelin. Specifically, UVB irradiation leads to p53 transcriptional activation of ghrelin in skin adipocytes, while a conditional p53-knockout in mice abolishes UVB-induced ghrelin expression and food-seeking behavior. In females, estrogen interferes with the p53–chromatin interaction on the ghrelin promoter, thus blocking ghrelin and food-seeking behavior in response to UVB exposure. These results identify the skin as a major mediator of energy homeostasis and may lead to therapeutic opportunities for sex-based treatments of endocrine-related diseases.","

This retrospective study included patients aged 40-90 years who were hospitalized at Fujita Health University Hospital. We collated the clinical data and prescriptions of all study participants. We also gathered data pertaining to risk factors according to Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Of the 1595 patients, the mean number of major osteoporotic fracture risk predicted using FRAX was 11.73%. The department of rheumatology showed the highest fracture risk (18.55 ± 16.81) and had the highest number of patients on medications that resulted in reduced bone mineral density (1.07 ± 0.98 medication). Based on the FRAX, the proportion of patients in the high-risk group in this department was significantly higher compared with those in the remaining departments with respect to glucocorticoid administration, rheumatoid arthritis, and secondary osteoporosis. However, the departments included in the high-risk group were not necessarily the same as the departments included in the top group, based on the administered medications. FRAX score is calculated based on various risk factors; however, only glucocorticoid corresponds to medications. We should focus on medication prescription patterns in addition to FRAX to improve fracture risk assessment in hospital-wide surveillance. Therefore, we recommend the use of FRAX along with the prescribed medications to identify departments that admit high-risk patients.","

AB  - To identify patients at a high risk for primary and secondary osteoporotic fractures using fracture risk assessments performed using the current method and the proposed method, in an acute care hospital and to identify departments where high-risk patients are admitted. This retrospective study included patients aged 40-90 years who were hospitalized at Fujita Health University Hospital. We collated the clinical data and prescriptions of all study participants. We also gathered data pertaining to risk factors according to Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Of the 1595 patients, the mean number of major osteoporotic fracture risk predicted using FRAX was 11.73%. The department of rheumatology showed the highest fracture risk (18.55 ± 16.81) and had the highest number of patients on medications that resulted in reduced bone mineral density (1.07 ± 0.98 medication). Based on the FRAX, the proportion of patients in the high-risk group in this department was significantly higher compared with those in the remaining departments with respect to glucocorticoid administration, rheumatoid arthritis, and secondary osteoporosis. However, the departments included in the high-risk group were not necessarily the same as the departments included in the top group, based on the administered medications. FRAX score is calculated based on various risk factors; however, only glucocorticoid corresponds to medications. We should focus on medication prescription patterns in addition to FRAX to improve fracture risk assessment in hospital-wide surveillance. Therefore, we recommend the use of FRAX along with the prescribed medications to identify departments that admit high-risk patients.

However, estrogen levels fluctuate during puberty, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause, which are related to variations in psoriasis symptoms observed in female patients. Estrogen has disease promoting or ameliorating functions based on the type of immune responses and tissues involved. To investigate the effects of estrogen on psoriasis, at first, we developed an innate immunity dependent mannan-induced psoriasis model, which showed a clear female preponderance in disease severity in several mouse strains. Next, we investigated the effects of endogenous and exogenous estrogen using ovariectomy and sham operated mice. 17-β-estradiol (E2) alone promoted the skin inflammation and it also significantly enhanced mannan-induced skin inflammation. We also observed a prominent estrogen receptor-β (ER-β) expression in the skin samples, especially on keratinocytes. Subsequently, we confirmed the effects of E2 on psoriasis using ER-β antagonist (PHTPP) and agonist (DPN). In addition, estrogen was found to affect the expression of certain genes (vgll3 and cebpb), microRNAs (miR146a and miR21), and immune cells (DCs and γδ T cells) as well as chemokines (CCL5 and CXCL10) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-22, IL-23, and IL-17 family), which promoted the skin inflammation. Thus, we demonstrate a pathogenic role for 17-β-estradiol in promoting skin inflammation, which should be considered while designing new treatment strategies for psoriasis patients.","

AB  - Sex-bias is more obvious in several autoimmune disorders, but not in psoriasis. However, estrogen levels fluctuate during puberty, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause, which are related to variations in psoriasis symptoms observed in female patients. Estrogen has disease promoting or ameliorating functions based on the type of immune responses and tissues involved. To investigate the effects of estrogen on psoriasis, at first, we developed an innate immunity dependent mannan-induced psoriasis model, which showed a clear female preponderance in disease severity in several mouse strains. Next, we investigated the effects of endogenous and exogenous estrogen using ovariectomy and sham operated mice. 17-β-estradiol (E2) alone promoted the skin inflammation and it also significantly enhanced mannan-induced skin inflammation. We also observed a prominent estrogen receptor-β (ER-β) expression in the skin samples, especially on keratinocytes.

In addition, estrogen was found to affect the expression of certain genes (vgll3 and cebpb), microRNAs (miR146a and miR21), and immune cells (DCs and γδ T cells) as well as chemokines (CCL5 and CXCL10) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-22, IL-23, and IL-17 family), which promoted the skin inflammation. Thus, we demonstrate a pathogenic role for 17-β-estradiol in promoting skin inflammation, which should be considered while designing new treatment strategies for psoriasis patients.

There are now several examples where these stratagems are being explored in the (pre)clinical phase of therapeutic trial programmes.

Setting Nationwide health insurance programme operated by the government with a near 100% coverage rate. Participants We identified women ≥45 years old in the Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, which contains data on a representative sample of one million enrollees. After exclusion of those who were diagnosed with CTS before the prescription of HRT, a total of 118 309 participants were included and followed up for 15 years starting from 1 January 1996. Both HRT and occurrence of CTS were identified using the insurance claims. Main outcome measures We identified incident patients of CTS and evaluated the association between HRT and CTS by calculating the OR. Results Of the 4535 participants who developed CTS during the study period, 2334 (51.5%) were HRT recipients. In participants without CTS, the proportion of HRT recipients was 28.1%, yielding an OR of 2.72 with a 95% CI of 2.56 to 2.88. After adjustment for age, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, gout and obesity, the OR of CTS associated with HRT was 2.04 (95% CI 1.91 to 2.17). While HRT, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and gout had similar effects on CTS across all age groups, hypothyroidism and obesity had different effects on different groups. Conclusion This study observed a positive association between HRT and CTS, independent of age, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, gout and obesity. While the ORs of CTS associated with HRT were similar across age groups, those associated with hypothyroidism and obesity were not, indicating effect modifications by age.","

We assessed the general neoplasia risk in TS women, and more specifically, the gonadoblastoma/dysgerminoma risk in the subgroup with Y chromosome mosaicism, and evaluated potential risk factors for neoplasia development, such as karyotype, metabolic and autoimmune comorbidity, and treatment with growth hormone and/or estrogen replacement. Design: 10-year retrospective cohort study in a tertiary referral centre in Belgium. Results: 105 TS women were included (median age 29; range 2–69). Six malignant tumours were detected in 5 (4.8%) patients (SIR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.2–1.0). In addition, 2 benign meningiomas were observed, resulting in 3 (2.9%) tumours of the central nervous system (CNS; SIR = 19.9, 95% CI 4.0–35.8). No breast cancer was noted. Benign neoplasms occurred in 22 women (21.0%), with skin lesions being the most frequent. All patients with Y chromosome mosaicism (n = 9; 8.6%) underwent prophylactic gonadectomy, but gonadoblastoma/dysgerminoma was not detected. A weak association was found between any tumour type and autoimmune comorbidity (r = 0.24; p = 0.02). Conclusion: The overall malignancy risk was not increased, but a different pattern of occurrence is apparent, with an increased risk of CNS and skin tumours and a decreased breast cancer risk. Gonadoblastoma/dysgerminoma was not reported. There is a need for centralised multidisciplinary care and prospective research to unravel and predict the neoplasia risk.","

Methods: We included 1,134,680 subjects who participated in national health examinations in 2009 in the study. The study outcomes were incident THRA or TKRA due to severe hip or knee OA. The relationships between reproductive factors and THRA or TKRA were evaluated using a multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards model. Results: During a mean follow-up duration of 8.2 years, 1,610 incident THRA cases and 60,670 incident TKRA cases were observed. Later age at menarche, longer breastfeeding, HRT and OC use were associated with increased risk of TKRA for severe knee OA, while later age at menopause and longer reproductive span were associated with decreased risk. With regard to THRA for severe hip OA, later menarche, longer breastfeeding, HRT more than 5 years, and OC use more than 1 year were associated with higher risk. The associations between reproductive factors and severe OA were more pronounced in underweight and younger subjects. Conclusion: We found that shorter estrogen exposure was associated with higher risk of TKRA due to severe knee OA, and such associations were more pronounced in underweight and younger subjects. The association between shorter estrogen exposure and THRA was not robust.","

Methods: In this randomized, controlled, open-label study, we assigned postmenopausal women with osteopenia who had been receiving low-dose GCs for RA to two groups: a group receiving bazedoxifene (20 mg/day) with elemental calcium 1200 mg and vitamin D 800 IU daily (bazedoxifene group) and a group receiving the same doses of calcium and vitamin D only (control group). As primary outcome, bone mineral density (BMD) change in the lumbar spine (L-spine) from baseline to 48 weeks was assessed. Changes in BMD in the femur, trabecular bone score, bone turnover markers, and development of fracture were assessed as secondary outcomes. For intention-to-treat analysis, 20 completed data sets were created by applying multiple imputations by chained equations. Results: A total of 114 patients (57 patients in each group) were recruited. A significant increase in L-spine BMD (0.015 g/cm2, P = 0.007) was observed in the bazedoxifene group, and the increase was significantly higher than in the control group (0.013, 95% CI 0.0003–0.026, P = 0.047).

Methods: E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès des femmes de la Mutuelle générale de l'Education Nationale) is an on-going French prospective cohort that included 98 995 women aged 40-65 years in 1990. Every 2-3 years, women completed mailed questionnaires on their lifestyles, reproductive factors and health conditions. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine factors associated with risk of incident RA, with age as the time scale, adjusted for known risk factors of RA, and considering endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors.

For early menopause, the association was of similar magnitude in ever and never smokers, although the association was statistically significant only in ever smokers (HR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.0, 2.3). We found a decreased risk in nulliparous women never exposed to smoking (HR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.2, 0.8). Risk of RA was inversely associated with exposure to progestogen only in perimenopause (>24 vs 0 months; multi-adjusted HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.6, 0.9).

Its prevalence is particularly elevated in specific geographical areas such as in the Oceania/Pacific region and is rising in the US, Europe, and Asia. Gout is a severe and painful disease, in which co-morbidities are responsible for a significant reduction in life expectancy. However, gout patients remain ostracized because the disease is still considered “self-inflicted”, as a result of unhealthy lifestyle and excessive food and alcohol intake. While the etiology of gout flares is clearly associated with the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposits, several major questions remain unanswered, such as the relationships between diet, hyperuricemia and gout flares or the mechanisms by which urate induces inflammation. Recent advances have identified gene variants associated with gout incidence. Nevertheless, genetic origins of gout combined to diet-related possible uric acid overproduction account for the symptoms in only a minor portion of patients. Hence, additional factors must be at play. Here, we review the impact of epigenetic mechanisms in which nutrients (such as ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and/or dietary-derived metabolites (like urate) trigger anti/pro-inflammatory responses that may participate in gout pathogenesis and severity. We propose that simple dietary regimens may be beneficial to complement therapeutic management or contribute to the prevention of flares in gout patients.","

AB  - Gout is the most frequent form of inflammatory arthritis in the world. Its prevalence is particularly elevated in specific geographical areas such as in the Oceania/Pacific region and is rising in the US, Europe, and Asia. Gout is a severe and painful disease, in which co-morbidities are responsible for a significant reduction in life expectancy. However, gout patients remain ostracized because the disease is still considered “self-inflicted”, as a result of unhealthy lifestyle and excessive food and alcohol intake. While the etiology of gout flares is clearly associated with the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposits, several major questions remain unanswered, such as the relationships between diet, hyperuricemia and gout flares or the mechanisms by which urate induces inflammation. Recent advances have identified gene variants associated with gout incidence. Nevertheless, genetic origins of gout combined to diet-related possible uric acid overproduction account for the symptoms in only a minor portion of patients. Hence, additional factors must be at play. Here, we review the impact of epigenetic mechanisms in which nutrients (such as ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and/or dietary-derived metabolites (like urate) trigger anti/pro-inflammatory responses that may participate in gout pathogenesis and severity. We propose that simple dietary regimens may be beneficial to complement therapeutic management or contribute to the prevention of flares in gout patients.

The EULAR recommends the use of TCZ, as a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), as second line therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when conventional DMARDs have failed achieving treatment target. The labelled dosing regimen for TCZ in RA is 8mg/kg (maximum 800mg) every 4 weeks. A TCZ predose serum concentration (TCZpsc) >1mg/L normalizes C-reactive protein, while clinical trials found mean TCZpsc of 19.9 ±17.0 mg/L in patients receiving the standard regimen. On the basis of these data, it can be hypothesized that cost-effectiveness of therapy can be improved. Objectives: In this study we evaluated TCZpsc in stable RA-patients to determine whether the TCZ 8mg/kg dose could be lowered while meeting the minimal required concentration for effective blockage of the IL-6 inflammatory cascade. Methods: Adult RA patients with stable disease (i.e. at least 3 months without treatment change) treated with intravenous TCZ were investigated in a prospective cohort study. TCZpsc before two different TCZ infusions over time was assessed. A validated ELISA was used to measure TCZpscs, immunogenicity was measured by quantifying human antibodies using antigen-binding tests (radioimmunoassay). A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was constructed using maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation applied on the available PK data in the literature combined with the collected data on dosing and predose concentrations in the study patients. Body surface area, creatinine clearance and gender were included as covariates in the model. A patient individual dose tapering strategy was predicted based on the derived model. The target TCZpsc was set on 8-10mg/L taking the measurement error of 15%, the use of the entire content of the vials and intra-individual variation into consideration. Results: A total of 44 patients were included [median (IQR) age: 63 (58-72), 75% female, mean (SD) DAS28-ESR: 1.5 (0.8)]. Half of the patients received TCZ in combination with a conventional DMARD, 32% used methotrexate (MTX). Patients received 7.7 ±0.8mg/kg (range 5.7-9.7) TCZ. Mean TCZpsc was 27.6 ±12.6mg/L. The intra-individual variance of TCZpsc was low; mean difference in individual TCZpscs was 0.56 (5.2)mg/L. Higher dosages (in mg/kg) were significantly associated with higher TCZpsc (regression coefficient 7.32 95%CI 2.73;11.9), suggesting overtreatment. No drug-neutralizing auto-antibodies were measured. Co-treatment with MTX did not influence the median TCZpsc (21.0mg/L versus 26.5mg/L without MTX, p=0.84). According to the measured TCZpsc, TCZ dosage could be lowered in 36 patients (92%). In a 28-days regimen, target-TCZpsc would be reached with a 0.4-4.6mg/kg dose-reduction (Figure 1). Extending the interval between two administrations would lead to low TCZpsc (<1mg/L). Considering the aimed average dose-reduction of 2.1 mg/kg per administration, efficacy would be expected to maintain (TCZpsc >1 mg/L) while reducing yearly costs with ±€3.900,-per patient. On average patients were started on TCZ treatment 63 months (SD26) earlier. As maximum efficacy of TCZ treatment can be achieved after 3 months, TCZpsc-guided dose reduction 3 months after start could have resulted in a total drug cost reduction of ±€750.000,-in our study population (±€19.500,-per patient). Conclusion: Measured TCZpsc under standard TCZ therapy was much higher than the minimal required concentration. These results suggest that the labelled TCZ dose leads to overtreatment and unnecessary costs in patients with stable RA. The TCZpsc seems supportive as an instrument for dose reduction strategies. Future prospective studies should assess its use in TCZ dose adjustment and confirm whether treatment efficacy is maintained.","

Several studies have suggested that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is closely associated with RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying Angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)] and its Mas receptor agonist (AVE0991) on joint inflammation and cardiac complications in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Methods: Collagen type II was injected into DBA/1 mice to construct an arthritis model. CIA mice were treated with Ang-(1–7) (2.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and AVE0991 (3.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1 β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)] were determined by ELISA. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in joint tissues and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad pathway and levels of α-Smooth muscle action (SMA) and β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein expression in cardiac tissues were assessed by western blots. The levels of TGF-β/Smad pathway, α-SMA, and β-MHC RNA in cardiac tissues were analyzed by real time-PCR. The levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa ligand (RANKL) and promoting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 expression in the ankle joints were detected by immunohistochemistry and real time-PCR. Results: Ang-(1–7) and AVE0991 reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways in ankle joint tissues, reduced RANKL and MMP3 expression, and ameliorated local joint inflammation and bone destruction compared with the control group. In addition, Ang-(1–7) and AVE0991 attenuated the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, reduced the levels of α-SMA and β-MHC expression, and diminished inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardial interstitium and myocardial interstitial fibrosis in the hearts of CIA mice. Conclusions: Ang-(1–7) alleviated joint damage caused by inflammation likely through the attenuation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways and ameliorated inflammation-induced cardiac fibrosis and activation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Moreover, Ang-(1–7) was likely mediated through the Mas receptor. This study provides theoretical evidence for exploring novel clinical therapeutic approaches for RA and its cardiac complications.","

AB  - Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disabling disease with a high incidence that is regularly accompanied by cardiovascular complications. Several studies have suggested that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is closely associated with RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying Angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)] and its Mas receptor agonist (AVE0991) on joint inflammation and cardiac complications in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Methods: Collagen type II was injected into DBA/1 mice to construct an arthritis model. CIA mice were treated with Ang-(1–7) (2.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and AVE0991 (3.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1 β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)] were determined by ELISA. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in joint tissues and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad pathway and levels of α-Smooth muscle action (SMA) and β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein expression in cardiac tissues were assessed by western blots. The levels of TGF-β/Smad pathway, α-SMA, and β-MHC RNA in cardiac tissues were analyzed by real time-PCR. The levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa ligand (RANKL) and promoting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 expression in the ankle joints were detected by immunohistochemistry and real time-PCR. Results: Ang-(1–7) and AVE0991 reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways in ankle joint tissues, reduced RANKL and MMP3 expression, and ameliorated local joint inflammation and bone destruction compared with the control group. In addition, Ang-(1–7) and AVE0991 attenuated the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, reduced the levels of α-SMA and β-MHC expression, and diminished inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardial interstitium and myocardial interstitial fibrosis in the hearts of CIA mice. Conclusions: Ang-(1–7) alleviated joint damage caused by inflammation likely through the attenuation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways and ameliorated inflammation-induced cardiac fibrosis and activation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Moreover, Ang-(1–7) was likely mediated through the Mas receptor. This study provides theoretical evidence for exploring novel clinical therapeutic approaches for RA and its cardiac complications.

Previous reports of drug-induced acanthosis nigricans have simply consisted of a list of drugs possibly implicated in causing acanthosis nigricans. Several drugs listed are based on single case reports without biopsy confirmation, report of clearing on stopping the drug or reporting on whether acanthosis nigricans recurred with drug rechallenge. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE(Ovid), Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. The authors screened the initial result of the search strategy by title and abstract using the following inclusion criteria: eligible studies included those with patients who developed acanthosis nigricans secondary to a drug. This study is the first to comprehensively review the drugs that have been implicated in the development of acanthosis nigricans. A total of 38 studies were included in the systematic review, and a total of 13 acanthosis nigricans inducing drugs were identified. Nicotinic acid and insulin were the two most significant drugs that were reported to cause acanthosis nigricans. By using the results of this study, we created a revised classification system of drug-induced acanthosis nigricans which can be used as a concise framework for clinicians to refer to.","

AB  - Drug-induced acanthosis nigricans is an uncommon subtype of acanthosis nigricans and the data on this topic is not well understood by clinicians as it is presently limited in the literature. Previous reports of drug-induced acanthosis nigricans have simply consisted of a list of drugs possibly implicated in causing acanthosis nigricans. Several drugs listed are based on single case reports without biopsy confirmation, report of clearing on stopping the drug or reporting on whether acanthosis nigricans recurred with drug rechallenge. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE(Ovid), Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. The authors screened the initial result of the search strategy by title and abstract using the following inclusion criteria: eligible studies included those with patients who developed acanthosis nigricans secondary to a drug. This study is the first to comprehensively review the drugs that have been implicated in the development of acanthosis nigricans. A total of 38 studies were included in the systematic review, and a total of 13 acanthosis nigricans inducing drugs were identified. Nicotinic acid and insulin were the two most significant drugs that were reported to cause acanthosis nigricans. By using the results of this study, we created a revised classification system of drug-induced acanthosis nigricans which can be used as a concise framework for clinicians to refer to.

(1,2) In cases with remitted multiple myeloma a bone loss is consecutive to the disorder itself. Methods: This is a case report. Bone was evaluated by central DXA and plan radiography. Phospho-calcic metabolism assay including bone turnover was performed. The informed consent was obtained. Case data: A 40-year-old female patient was admitted for evaluation 10 y after menopause (she did not receive estrogens therapy). Her medical history revealed chronic prednisone treatment for seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma (which is currently in remission), arterial hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. DXA showed decreased BMD of 0.789 g/cm2 with a T-score of - 3.4 SD measured at lumbar spine L3-L4.

The myeloma was considered in remission based on oncologic evaluation. X-ray of the spine showed vertebral fractures at thoracic T4-T8 and T12 vertebras. Therapy with risedronate 75 mg, 2 oral doses per month and vitamin D 2000 UI daily was introduced. A year later a was operated for perforated peptic ulcer.

Conclusion: The combination of multiple risk factors and complex systemic pathology is a real challenge in choosing the optimal therapy for osteoporosis.

Starting from risk factors, women are more likely to be susceptible to unhealthy behaviors and risk factors that have different impact on CV morbidity and mortality as compared to men. Despite the large body of evidence as regards the effect of lifestyle factors on the CVD onset, the gender-specific effect of traditional and non-traditional risk factors on the prognosis of patients with already established CVD has not been well investigated and understood. Furthermore, CVD in women is often misdiagnosed, underestimated, and undertreated. Women also experience hormonal changes from adolescence till elder life that affect CV physiology. Unfortunately, in most of the clinical trials women are underrepresented, leading to the limited knowledge of CV and systemic impact effects of several treatment modalities on women's health. Thus, in this consensus, a group of female cardiologists from the Hellenic Society of Cardiology presents the special features of CVD in women: the different needs in primary and secondary prevention, as well as therapeutic strategies that may be implemented in daily clinical practice to eliminate underestimation and undertreatment of CVD in the female population.","

AB  - The perception that women represent a low-risk population for cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) needs to be reconsidered. Starting from risk factors, women are more likely to be susceptible to unhealthy behaviors and risk factors that have different impact on CV morbidity and mortality as compared to men. Despite the large body of evidence as regards the effect of lifestyle factors on the CVD onset, the gender-specific effect of traditional and non-traditional risk factors on the prognosis of patients with already established CVD has not been well investigated and understood. Furthermore, CVD in women is often misdiagnosed, underestimated, and undertreated. Women also experience hormonal changes from adolescence till elder life that affect CV physiology. Unfortunately, in most of the clinical trials women are underrepresented, leading to the limited knowledge of CV and systemic impact effects of several treatment modalities on women's health. Thus, in this consensus, a group of female cardiologists from the Hellenic Society of Cardiology presents the special features of CVD in women: the different needs in primary and secondary prevention, as well as therapeutic strategies that may be implemented in daily clinical practice to eliminate underestimation and undertreatment of CVD in the female population.

Factor VIII (FVIII:C) and von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:ag) levels increase with age in the general population. Aims. To evaluate whether the increase of FVIII:C and VWF:Ag with age in the population is mediated by estrogen use, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, impaired kidney function, or high levels of C reactive protein (CRP). Methods. Analyses were performed in a sample from the general population in the Netherlands (n=2823). Individuals with active cancer and women who were pregnant or within nine months postpartum were excluded, since these transient conditions are strong mediators of VWF and FVIII levels. FVIII:C was measured on an automatic coagulometer (STA-R) and VWF:Ag with an immunoturbidimetric method (STA Liatest). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the MDRD equation. Information on estrogen use, BMI, and comorbidities (diabetes, liver and kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, bronchitis, emphysema, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, peripheral vascular disease) was obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the change in FVIII:C and VWF:Ag levels with age. Log-transformation was performed for CRP, obtaining a normal distribution. Analyses were adjusted for sex, hormone use (oral contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy), BMI, comorbidities, CRP, and eGFR. Results. Mean age was 49 years (SD 12), 48% were men. Comorbidities were present in 444 individuals (16%), hormone use in 425 women (31% of women). Mean BMI was 25.6kg/squared meter (SD 4), mean CRP 2.83 mg/L (SD 5.68), mean eGFR 87 mL/min (SD 17). Mean levels of FVIII:C and VWF:Ag were 112 IU/dL (SD 38) and 112 (SD 47), respectively. FVIII:C and VWF:Ag increased with age, i.e., increase per decade of age (β) for FVIII:C: 8 IU/dL, 95%CI 7-9 and for VWF:Ag: 11 IU/dL, 95%CI 10-13. Adjustment for eGFR led to marginally different estimates: FVIII:C: β 7 IU/dL, 95%CI 6-8, VWF:Ag: 10 IU/dL, 95%CI 8-11. Further adjustment for sex, estrogen use, BMI, comorbidities, and CRP (individually or in the full model) did not affect the association between biomarkers and age (full model: FVIII:C: β 5 IU/dL, 95%CI 4-7, VWF:Ag: 8 IU/dL, 95%CI 6-9). Conclusions. The increase of FVIII:C and VWF:Ag with age is only marginally mediated by estrogen use, BMI, comorbidities, eGFR, or CRP.","

In the literature, findings on the association between reproductive and hormonal factors, taken individually, and RA are confl icting. Our objectives were to assess the relationships between lifetime durations/level of female hormonal exposures and the risk of RA. Methods: E3N is an ongoing French prospective cohort of 98,995 women since 1990 aged 40-65 years at enrolment. Validation of RA cases among the cohort has been previously published [Nguyen et al. BMJ Open 2019]. Lifetime female hormonal exposures were defined as follows: - Reproductive span (in years) = duration from menarche to menopause - Total ovulatory years (in years, time-dependent) = Reproductive span - (number of full-term pregnancies x 0.75 + number of miscarriages x 0.25 + total duration of breast feeding + total duration of oral contraception) - Lifetime hormonal exposure (in years, time-dependent) = Reproductive span + total duration of menopausal hormonal therapy - Composite Estrogen Score (CES, range = 0-5, time-dependent), calculated by point assignment for early menarche (≤10 years), high parity (>3 pregnancies), history of hysterectomy, use of hormone therapy (oral contraception and/or menopausal hormonal therapy, ever) and late menopause (≥53 years). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of incident RA were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time scale. Models were adjusted for age (age-adjusted model) and additionally for smoking, passive smoking during childhood, educational level, body mass index, duration of premenopausal progestogen, age at the first pregnancy and type of menopause (multi-adjusted model). Results: A total of 637 incident RA cases occurred among 78,391 post-menopausal women with a total of 1,864,915 women-years from baseline. Reproductive span, total ovulatory years and lifetime hormonal exposure were not significantly associated with incident RA in postmenopausal women in age adjusted models (p for trend =0.2479, p for trend =0.4343, p for trend =0.9216 , respectively). In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models, high level of estrogen exposure (CES=3-5) was inversely associated with the risk of RA in post-menopausal women: HR=0.65 (95%CI 0.4-0.9), p =0.04, taking low level (CES=0-1) as reference (Table). Interestingly, in a recent publication, high level of CES was associated with a reduced risk of primary Sjögren, but not cumulative menstrual cycling (reproductive span minus time to pregnant) [McCoy et al. Arthritis Care Res 2019]. RA and primary Sjögren share a marked female predominance with a peak onset around menopause and the participation of B lymphocytes in this physiopathology. Conclusion: In E3N cohort, a high CES which refl ects lifetime exposure to estrogen was associated with a decreased risk of RA in postmenopausal women.","

By preventing peripheral estrogen production, AIs magnify the effects of estrogen suppression during menopause causing accelerated bone loss at a rate 2-4 times higher than expected. Approximately 1 in 5 women treated with AI therapy will suffer from a fracture, increasing their risk of mortality. AI therapy is also used in men for the treatment of gynecomastia, but there is a lack of data regarding the effects of AIs on bone loss in men. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends obtaining a baseline DXA in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with an AI. Several studies have shown this screening is suboptimal but cost-effective in the U.S. The aim of this study was to assess our adherence to osteoporosis screening in patients on AI therapy and to understand factors that may influence screening. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, clinic and hospital medical records were used to identify and analyze subjects on an aromatase inhibitor from January 2015 - January 2020. Descriptive and statistical analyses using Pearson's Chi-Square were used to compare the characteristics of subjects who received DXA screening to those who did not. Results: We identified 4,340 subjects on AI therapy from 2,248,780 charts available in the medical record system, giving AI therapy a prevalence of 0.19%. Of those, 3,797 (87.4%) were female and 549 (12.6%) were male. A DXA was ordered in 818 (19%) subjects and was not ordered in 3,522 (81%) subjects. Ninety-eight percent of subjects who had a DXA ordered were females [X2 (1, N=4340)=100.42, p< 0.01]. DXA screening was more likely to be ordered in subjects aged 65 years or older with a history of alcohol use [X2(2, N=4340)=54.94, p< 0.01], rheumatoid arthritis [X2(1, N=4340)=17.45, p< 0.01], hypogonadism [X2(1, N=4340)=70.60, p< 0.01], and fragility fracture [X2(1, N=4340)=5.32, p< 0.025]. Among those who had DXA screening, the above factors were present in 51%, 5%, 2%, and 5%, respectively. Subjects with glucocorticoid [X2(1, N=4340)=30.93, p< 0.01], bisphosphonate [X2(1, N=4340)=7.79, p< 0.01], or vitamin D use [X2(1, N=4340)=35.92, p< 0.01] were also more likely to have DXA screening. Conclusion: This investigation highlighted that osteoporosis screening for patients on AI therapy is low, despite the current guidelines. The osteoporosis risk factors associated with higher rates of screening were advanced age, alcohol use, rheumatoid arthritis, hypogonadism, and history of a fragility fracture. The rate of DXA screening was similar for patients with low BMI, tobacco use, type I diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, liver disease, premature menopause, chronic malnutrition, and a family history of hip fracture. Males encompass nearly 13% of our population on AI therapy, and future studies are needed to understand the impact of AI treatment on bone health in men. More intense osteoporosis screening is needed for patients on AI therapy, especially for those with additional risk factors, and can be achieved through multidisciplinary collaboration.","

AI therapy is also used in men for the treatment of gynecomastia, but there is a lack of data regarding the effects of AIs on bone loss in men. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends obtaining a baseline DXA in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with an AI. Several studies have shown this screening is suboptimal but cost-effective in the U.S. The aim of this study was to assess our adherence to osteoporosis screening in patients on AI therapy and to understand factors that may influence screening. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, clinic and hospital medical records were used to identify and analyze subjects on an aromatase inhibitor from January 2015 - January 2020. Descriptive and statistical analyses using Pearson's Chi-Square were used to compare the characteristics of subjects who received DXA screening to those who did not. Results: We identified 4,340 subjects on AI therapy from 2,248,780 charts available in the medical record system, giving AI therapy a prevalence of 0.19%. Of those, 3,797 (87.4%) were female and 549 (12.6%) were male. A DXA was ordered in 818 (19%) subjects and was not ordered in 3,522 (81%) subjects. Ninety-eight percent of subjects who had a DXA ordered were females [X2 (1, N=4340)=100.42, p< 0.01]. DXA screening was more likely to be ordered in subjects aged 65 years or older with a history of alcohol use [X2(2, N=4340)=54.94, p< 0.01], rheumatoid arthritis [X2(1, N=4340)=17.45, p< 0.01], hypogonadism [X2(1, N=4340)=70.60, p< 0.01], and fragility fracture [X2(1, N=4340)=5.32, p< 0.025]. Among those who had DXA screening, the above factors were present in 51%, 5%, 2%, and 5%, respectively. Subjects with glucocorticoid [X2(1, N=4340)=30.93, p< 0.01], bisphosphonate [X2(1, N=4340)=7.79, p< 0.01], or vitamin D use [X2(1, N=4340)=35.92, p< 0.01] were also more likely to have DXA screening. Conclusion: This investigation highlighted that osteoporosis screening for patients on AI therapy is low, despite the current guidelines. The osteoporosis risk factors associated with higher rates of screening were advanced age, alcohol use, rheumatoid arthritis, hypogonadism, and history of a fragility fracture. The rate of DXA screening was similar for patients with low BMI, tobacco use, type I diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, liver disease, premature menopause, chronic malnutrition, and a family history of hip fracture. Males encompass nearly 13% of our population on AI therapy, and future studies are needed to understand the impact of AI treatment on bone health in men. More intense osteoporosis screening is needed for patients on AI therapy, especially for those with additional risk factors, and can be achieved through multidisciplinary collaboration.

This narrative review examines recent developments in using specific risk factors used to assess fracture risk, with a focus on publications in the last 3 years. Recent Findings: There is expanding evidence for the recognition of individual clinical risk factors and clinical use of composite scores in the general population. Unfortunately, enthusiasm is dampened by three pragmatic randomized trials that raise questions about the effectiveness of widespread population screening using clinical fracture prediction tools given suboptimal participation and adherence. There have been refinements in risk assessment in special populations: men, patients with diabetes, and secondary causes of osteoporosis. New evidence supports the value of vertebral fracture assessment (VFA), high resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT), opportunistic screening using CT, skeletal strength assessment with finite element analysis (FEA), and trabecular bone score (TBS). Summary: The last 3 years have seen important developments in the area of fracture risk assessment, both in the research setting and translation to clinical practice. The next challenge will be incorporating these advances into routine work flows that can improve the identification of high risk individuals at the population level and meaningfully impact the ongoing crisis in osteoporosis management.","

Summary: The last 3 years have seen important developments in the area of fracture risk assessment, both in the research setting and translation to clinical practice. The next challenge will be incorporating these advances into routine work flows that can improve the identification of high risk individuals at the population level and meaningfully impact the ongoing crisis in osteoporosis management.

In multiple imputation (MI), covariates are included in the imputation equation to predict the values of missing data. Objectives: To find the best approach to estimate and impute the missing values in Kuwait Registry for Rheumatic Diseases (KRRD) patients data. Methods: A number of methods were implemented for dealing with missing data. These included Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA), EM with Bootstrapping (Amelia II), Sequential Random Forest (MissForest) and mean imputation.

Tetrandrine, a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has been widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis clinically in China. Here, we demonstrate that tetrandrine significantly prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss and inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. In vivo, we found that intraperitoneal injection of tetrandrine (30 mg/kg) every other day markedly reduced bone loss in ovariectomized mice and the serum levels of TRAcp5b, TNF-a, IL-6, CTX-I, and RANKL/OPG were significantly decreased. In vitro, we found that tetrandrine significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) and RAW264.7 cells according to the results of osteoclastogenesis-related gene expression, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and actin-ring formation as well as bone resorption assay. Mechanistically, tetrandrine inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by suppressing NF-kB, Ca2+, PI3K/AKT, and MAPKs signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings suggest that tetrandrine suppresses osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways and has potential value as a therapeutic agent for PMOP, especially for those suffering from RA and PMOP at the same time.","

We sought to assess fracture history and BMD in women with Turner syndrome (TS) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Patients: Two hundred and sixty seven women with TS (median age 34.3 years) and 67 women with POI (median age 28.1 years).

Clinical data included height, weight, serum vitamin D and hip and spine T-scores, which were adjusted for height and age. Fractures were subdivided into major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) and ‘other’ fracture types. Results: Overall fracture rate was similar in women with TS and POI (82 [30.5%] vs 22 [32.8%] respectively, P =.74). Compared to women with POI, those with TS had more fractures at MOF sites (30.2% vs 52.7%, P =.012) and fewer phalangeal fractures (27.9% vs 9.8%, P =.005). There was no difference in BMD between women who sustained a fracture compared to those who did not. Women with TS who fractured were more likely to suffer from hearing impairment compared to those with no fracture (62.2% vs 48.1%, P =.045). Conclusions: TS is not associated with an overall excess risk of bone fracture. The higher rate of fractures at MOF sites in women with TS may be secondary to hearing impairment, thin cortical bone and abnormal bone remodelling.","

Combined oral contraceptives have complex, sometimes contradictory, effects on AIDs; they can worsen the situation in women with systemic lupus erythematosus and with anti-phospholipid syndrome, conditions in which they are contraindicated. Early studies indicated a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whereas more recent trials failed to do so, possibly because of the lowering of oestrogen content. Evidence of effects on multiple sclerosis (MS) is conflicting: risk may vary depending on the progestin used. Minor adverse effects may exist on inflammatory bowel diseases, and no significant effect was found on autoimmune thyroid diseases. Women can become sensitised to sex hormones. Progestin-only contraceptives may be used, although copper-releasing intra-uterine devices represent the best option. Finally, several organisations have issued guidelines for contraceptive use in women with AIDs.","

AB  - Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) affect women and men with a 2:1 ratio, which suggests that hormonal contraceptives play a role in their clinical course. Combined oral contraceptives have complex, sometimes contradictory, effects on AIDs; they can worsen the situation in women with systemic lupus erythematosus and with anti-phospholipid syndrome, conditions in which they are contraindicated. Early studies indicated a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whereas more recent trials failed to do so, possibly because of the lowering of oestrogen content. Evidence of effects on multiple sclerosis (MS) is conflicting: risk may vary depending on the progestin used. Minor adverse effects may exist on inflammatory bowel diseases, and no significant effect was found on autoimmune thyroid diseases. Women can become sensitised to sex hormones. Progestin-only contraceptives may be used, although copper-releasing intra-uterine devices represent the best option. Finally, several organisations have issued guidelines for contraceptive use in women with AIDs.

Methods: We conducted a population-based nationwide cohort study of 17,168 patients newly diagnosed with PCa between 1996 and 2013 using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Cox proportional hazards models with 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis were used to investigate the association between ADT use and the risk of autoimmune diseases. The autoimmune diseases included Graves’ disease, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Sjogren’s syndrome, myasthenia gravis, pernicious anemia, hereditary hemolytic anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, Celiac disease, uveitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Behcet’s disease, polymyositis, alopecia areata, Wegener’s granulomatosis, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, Goodpasture syndrome, giant cell arteritis, thromboangitis obliterans, arteritis obliterans, and Kawasaki disease. The duration of ADT use as a time-dependent variable was also examined for its association with autoimmune diseases. We also performed six secondary analyses. Results: Of the 17,168 selected PCa patients, 14,444 patients met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching, 5590 ADT users and 5590 non-ADT users were included in the study cohort. A propensity score-matched analysis (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.619, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51–0.75, P < 0.001) demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of autoimmune diseases in ADT users. A significant decrease in the risk of autoimmune diseases with increasing ADT duration was also demonstrated (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We observed that ADT use in patients with PCa was associated with a decreased risk of autoimmune diseases. These novel findings provide a potential role for androgen deprivation therapy in the modification of inflammation and autoimmunity in Asian patients with prostate cancer.","

The background for those gender bias is not fully understood yet, but seems to be the result of a complex interaction between sex hormones, (epi-)genetics, and possibly even the composition of gut microbiota. Moreover, time of disease onset, the clinical phenotype including co-morbidities as well as the course of the diseases during life differ between genders. The patient’s sex therefore plays an emerging role for individual therapy decisions and co-morbidity screening in rheumatologic care. Male lupus patients, for example, tend to show more severe features such as renal involvement, pleurisy, and serositis, when being compared to female patients. Among RA patients, women are more likely to acquire conditions like thyroid dysfunctions, fibromyalgia, and depression than their male counterparts. These examples emphasize the importance of the patient’s gender for the clinical routine and the resulting implications for prevention and therapy. The present article is going to review potential causes for the female predominance of rheumatic diseases and will examine the gender’s impact on the disease phenotype, symptom severity, co-morbidities, and quality of life. For reasons of scope, the focus will be on RA and SLE as two of the most important rheumatic diseases with a large socioeconomic impact on society due to their incidence as well as mortality.","

AB  - Inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) show a striking female predominance ranging from 3:1 in RA up to 9:1 in SLE. The background for those gender bias is not fully understood yet, but seems to be the result of a complex interaction between sex hormones, (epi-)genetics, and possibly even the composition of gut microbiota. Moreover, time of disease onset, the clinical phenotype including co-morbidities as well as the course of the diseases during life differ between genders. The patient’s sex therefore plays an emerging role for individual therapy decisions and co-morbidity screening in rheumatologic care. Male lupus patients, for example, tend to show more severe features such as renal involvement, pleurisy, and serositis, when being compared to female patients. Among RA patients, women are more likely to acquire conditions like thyroid dysfunctions, fibromyalgia, and depression than their male counterparts. These examples emphasize the importance of the patient’s gender for the clinical routine and the resulting implications for prevention and therapy. The present article is going to review potential causes for the female predominance of rheumatic diseases and will examine the gender’s impact on the disease phenotype, symptom severity, co-morbidities, and quality of life. For reasons of scope, the focus will be on RA and SLE as two of the most important rheumatic diseases with a large socioeconomic impact on society due to their incidence as well as mortality.

Main techniques are ovulation induction with or without intrauterine insemination, controlled ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Intrauterine insemination: sperm (from partner or donor) is inserted directly into woman's cervix, or uterus at the time of ovulation. Controlled ovarian stimulation is aimed at stimulate ovarian to allow egg retrieval few hours later. Protocols usually include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or antagonists associated with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (with concomitant close ovarian monitoring). Controlled ovarian stimulation is generally followed by egg retrieval and then by IVF, which is performed in the laboratory by putting into contact collected oocytes with sperm (partner or donor). Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is performed in case of inadequate quality of the partner's sperm (oligospermia notably). One or 2 embryos are transferred in utero 2/3 or 5 days later (or during the next cycle), while other good quality embryos are cryopreserved for later use. There is no difference in the rates of ongoing pregnancy between transfers of frozen or fresh embryos [1]. By definition, an IVF procedure is defined by the transvaginal egg retrieval: even if the X obtained embryos are implanted Y times, this is still counted as the same procedure. A retrospective study of 14,469 women undergoing IVF, found that the cumulative live birth rates by procedure steadily increased with the number of collected oocytes, reaching 70%when >25 oocytes had been retrieved [2]. Women with auto-immune diseases or inflammatory chronic rheumatisms may have infertility as in the general population or because of previous gonadotoxic treatment as cyclophosphamide. While artificial inseminations and oocyte or embryo donations can be considered equivalent to a natural conception in terms of risk, particular attention is needed during IVF in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and/or biology (APL) because of the increased level of estradiol after ovarian stimulation (risk of lupus flare and of thrombosis) [3]. Ovulation induction treatments with in vitro fertilization can be safely used in patients with SLE with stable/inactive disease [4]. Similarly, women with rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthritis can underwent IVF safely. In case of APS or APL, an adaptation of the treatment is usually required, especially around the egg retrieval. Management of pregnancy (both treatment and monitoring) must be planned before IVF [4]. As for a natural pregnancy, pre-counselling is important to adapt the treatment (interruption of contraindicated drugs in pregnancy as mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate before conception due to their potential teratogenicity or at the end of the second trimester for anti TNF agents) [4]. Some treatments, especially hydroxychloroquine in SLE, have to be maintained during all this period and during pregnancy. In women with APS or APL, prophylactic dose of low weight molecular heparin (LWMH) is recommended during the period of stimulation. In case of treatment with coumadine, switch for curative LWMH is needed. In both cases, short interruption is required for the oocyte puncture. Low dose of aspirin is added after the embryo implantation. Folic supplement is recommended, especially in cases of recent treatment with methotrexate of current treatment with sul-fasalazine. Immunizations are also important. Given its potential to reduce the miscarriage rate, LT4 supplementation is recommended for infertile women with subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmun-ity who are undergoing IVF [5]. Finally, a key role of inflammatory immune response has been shown in reproductive failures but a recent meta-analysis did not find any positive effect of immuno-therapy (especially anti-TNF) in improving the live birth rate in women undergoing IVF treatment [6].","

It is assumed that the incidence is underestimated, as the angiographic appearance of SCAD may often mimic atherosclerosis. This review aims to examine SCAD by focusing on the associated predisposing factors and precipitating stressors in this heterogeneous patient population, as well as the best treatment approach and the prognosis. Progressive knowledge has improved our current understanding of SCAD, but more awareness among clinicians is necessary. Recently, two position papers from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have been released, which will be summarised in brief.","

AB  - Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) represents around 25% of cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in women aged 40–65 years who have few or no traditional cardiovascular risk factors. It is assumed that the incidence is underestimated, as the angiographic appearance of SCAD may often mimic atherosclerosis. This review aims to examine SCAD by focusing on the associated predisposing factors and precipitating stressors in this heterogeneous patient population, as well as the best treatment approach and the prognosis. Progressive knowledge has improved our current understanding of SCAD, but more awareness among clinicians is necessary. Recently, two position papers from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have been released, which will be summarised in brief.

Compared to other malignancies, the role of tumor immune response (TIR) in endometrial carcinomas (ECs) is far understudied. We aimed to characterize the associations of EC inflammatory response with tumor phenotype and host non-genetic exposures. Design: Incident ECs arising in the Nurses' Health Study between 1976 and 2012 were included (n=325). Immune cells within tumors and biomarker expression in tumor epithelium were assessed with tissue microarrays (Figure 1). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between inflammatory profiles and tumor features with adjustment for known EC risk factors. Immune marker expression was evaluated at different cut points in increments (5-100 cells/mm2) to determine appropriate binary categorizations. Results: Inflammatory cells were present in varying levels in ECs. Increased tumor DNA damage was associated with more leukocyte recruitment (>=200 cells/mm2 )(Figure 2). Trends correlated with tumor subtypes included poorly differentiated endometrioid ECs with increased T cells (>=350 cells/mm2), and non-endometrioid ECs with increased macrophages (>=150 cells/mm2). History of rheumatoid arthritis conferred 2-fold increased odds of more T helper cells (>=60 cells/mm2) in ECs. Several immune subpopulations (leukocytes, T cells, T helper cells, FOXP3+ T cells and B cells) were also mildly elevated with longer use of combined estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy. In contrast, former use of aspirin decreased by 3-fold the odds of elevated leukocytes and T cells compared to never aspirin use. Longer oral contraceptive use was correlated with reduced levels of cytotoxic T cells (<25 cells/mm2) and plasma cells (<7 cells/mm2). In addition, obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) was associated with decreased leukocytes, FOXP3+ T cells and plasma cells in ECs (Figure 2). Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that TIR in ECs is co-determined by tumor phenotype as well as host physiologic, hormonal and drug exposures. The differential association patterns seen with different immune cell populations highlight tumor and host risk factors that may promote and suppress TIR in ECs. The findings underscore an interaction between TIR and local environment, and inform follow-up studies to investigate whether and how inflammatory pathways in the endometrium may be manipulated to reduce risk of tumor development and spread.","

Phytoconstituents play an important role in the growth, development, defensive mechanism, colors, odour and flavors of plants. Psoralea corylifolia Linn (P. corylifolia) commonly known as ‘Bakuchi’ belongs to Leguminosae family widely distributed in China and Southeastern Asian countries. Methods: Various electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google were searched to collect the data of the present review. Further, all the collected information was categorized into different section as per the aim of the paper. Moreover, analyzed data were also presented in the graphical abstract. Results: Seventy-two research and review papers have been collected and were included in the present review. Nineteen papers contained general information’s of P. corylifolia, Psoralens and psoralidin whereas thirty paper data were presented in the pharmacological activities sections and remaining in the Analytical tools and discussion section. From these databases, we can say that P. corylifolia possesses antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antioxidant, antiflarial, estrogenic, antitumour, and immunomodulatory activities. Psoralens are mainly used in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo and dermatitis. Topical or oral psoralens followed by UVA radiation exposure are one of the best treatments of leucoderma. Psoralidin exhibits antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. Conclusion: This review summarizes an overview of P. corylifolia, psoralen and its derivative psoralidin with respects to their pharmacological activities, medicinal uses, biological activities and bioanalytical aspects. These data will be helpful in the translation of information from traditional to the modern medicine of psoralidin.","

AB  - Background: Phytoconstituents of fruits, vegetables, spice and herbs are important for human health. Phytoconstituents play an important role in the growth, development, defensive mechanism, colors, odour and flavors of plants. Psoralea corylifolia Linn (P. corylifolia) commonly known as ‘Bakuchi’ belongs to Leguminosae family widely distributed in China and Southeastern Asian countries. Methods: Various electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google were searched to collect the data of the present review. Further, all the collected information was categorized into different section as per the aim of the paper. Moreover, analyzed data were also presented in the graphical abstract. Results: Seventy-two research and review papers have been collected and were included in the present review. Nineteen papers contained general information’s of P. corylifolia, Psoralens and psoralidin whereas thirty paper data were presented in the pharmacological activities sections and remaining in the Analytical tools and discussion section. From these databases, we can say that P. corylifolia possesses antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antioxidant, antiflarial, estrogenic, antitumour, and immunomodulatory activities. Psoralens are mainly used in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo and dermatitis. Topical or oral psoralens followed by UVA radiation exposure are one of the best treatments of leucoderma. Psoralidin exhibits antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. Conclusion: This review summarizes an overview of P. corylifolia, psoralen and its derivative psoralidin with respects to their pharmacological activities, medicinal uses, biological activities and bioanalytical aspects. These data will be helpful in the translation of information from traditional to the modern medicine of psoralidin.

Genetic defects in iron signaling to hepcidin lead to “hepcidinopathies” ranging from hereditary hemochromatosis to iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, which are disorders caused by hepcidin deficiency or excess, respectively. Moreover, dysregulation of hepcidin is a pathogenic cofactor in iron-loading anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis and in anemia of inflammation. Experiments with preclinical animal models provided evidence that restoration of appropriate hepcidin levels can be used for the treatment of these conditions. This fueled the rapidly growing field of hepcidin therapeutics. Several hepcidin agonists and antagonists, as well as inducers and inhibitors of hepcidin expression have been identified to date. Some of them were further developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This review summarizes the state of the art.","

AB  - Hepcidin is a key hormonal regulator of systemic iron homeostasis and its expression is induced by iron or inflammatory stimuli. Genetic defects in iron signaling to hepcidin lead to “hepcidinopathies” ranging from hereditary hemochromatosis to iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, which are disorders caused by hepcidin deficiency or excess, respectively. Moreover, dysregulation of hepcidin is a pathogenic cofactor in iron-loading anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis and in anemia of inflammation. Experiments with preclinical animal models provided evidence that restoration of appropriate hepcidin levels can be used for the treatment of these conditions. This fueled the rapidly growing field of hepcidin therapeutics. Several hepcidin agonists and antagonists, as well as inducers and inhibitors of hepcidin expression have been identified to date. Some of them were further developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This review summarizes the state of the art.

The principal mechanism by which MTX suppresses inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis is thought to be enhanced adenosine release from cells which suppresses inflammation by stimulating adenosine receptors on T cells, macrophages and other inflammatory cells (Nature Rev Rheumatol 13:41, 2017). Many patients do not respond to low dose MTX and studies in mice suggest that MTX resistance may be due to inadequately increased adenosine release (Clin Exp Rheumatol 31:433, 2013). Because adenosine is primarily taken up by cells from the extracellular space via the nucleoside transporter ent1 we asked whether an agent that blocks adenosine uptake could enhance the effect of MTX in the treatment of RA. We therefore carried out an open label 1 month study, adding an inhibitor of adenosine uptake via ent1, ticagrelor (a P2Y12 inhibitor that is approved for inhibition of platelet aggregation to prevent severe cardiovascular events) (Nat Rev Cardiology12:156,2014), to patients who were poorly controlled with low dose methotrexate therapy for RA. (NCT02874092) Methods: Patients (5 female/1 male, mean age 49.6 years) who all met ACR criteria for RA and had active disease, as defined by DAS28 (ESR) > 3.6 and who were on stable doses of MTX monotherapy (for a minimum of 12 weeks), were recruited from the Bellevue Hospital Center Arthritis Clinic. Patients had no known contraindication to ticagrelor and had no history of coronary artery disease. After giving informed consent patients entered an open label protocol in which they were administered Ticagrelor (90mg) twice daily for one month in addition to their stable dose of MTX. Disease activity was reassessed and change in activity from the start of the trial was noted. This study was approved by the NYULMCBellevue IRB. Results: Five of six patient achieved an improvement in their DAS28(ESR) >0.6. Half of the patients (3 patients) achieved a reduction in DAS28 (ESR) >1.2, 2 patients achieved a reduction in DAS28 (ESR) >0.6 but less than 1.2 and 1 patient showed no improvement. Four of six patients had a reduction in their tender joints and all had a reduction in swollen joints. No patients reported any adverse reactions, including excessive bleeding. Conclusion: The results of this small open label trial suggest that treatment with ticagrelor enhances the effect of MTX on RA and may be a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium. Moreover, these results offer further support for the hypothesis that enhanced adenosine release at inflamed sites mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of MTX therapy. The limitations of this trial include the fact that it was an open label trial in a small group of patients but the results support further study of ticagrelor in combination with MTX.

This retrospective cohort study, conducted within four Kaiser Permanente integrated health system regions, included 39,502 women aged ≥45 years with ≥3 years exposure to BP. Participants with a BP holiday (≥12 months with no use) were compared to persistent (use with ≥50% adherence) and nonpersistent (use with <50% adherence) users for incident osteoporosis-related fractures. The BP holiday (n = 11,497), nonpersistent user (n = 10,882), and persistent user groups (n = 17,123) were observed for 156,657 person-years. A total of 5199 osteoporosis-related fractures (including 1515 hip fractures and 2147 vertebral fractures) were observed. Compared to the persistent use group, there was a slight difference in overall osteoporosis-related fracture risk (HR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99)and no difference in hip fracture risk (HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.10) for the BP holiday group. A slight reduction in risk of vertebral fracture was observed (HR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.95).

Methods: A multidisciplinary, multi-organizational panel of experts in medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, urology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialist, and advocacy was convened to develop the clinical practice guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and case series published from 2000 through 2017. Results: The systematic review identified 204 eligible publications. Much of the evidence consisted of systematic reviews of observational data, consensus guidelines, case series, and case reports. Due to the paucity of high-quality evidence on management of immune-related adverse events, recommendations are based on expert consensus. Recommendations: Recommendations for specific organ system-based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert to grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d). Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require infliximab or other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, with the exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.","

AB  - Purpose: To increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy. Methods: A multidisciplinary, multi-organizational panel of experts in medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, urology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialist, and advocacy was convened to develop the clinical practice guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and case series published from 2000 through 2017. Results: The systematic review identified 204 eligible publications. Much of the evidence consisted of systematic reviews of observational data, consensus guidelines, case series, and case reports. Due to the paucity of high-quality evidence on management of immune-related adverse events, recommendations are based on expert consensus. Recommendations: Recommendations for specific organ system-based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert to grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d). Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require infliximab or other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, with the exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.

Only in certain granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis does the extra renal tissue produce sufficient 1,25(OH)2D to contribute to the circulating levels, generally associated with hypercalcemia, as illustrated by the case report preceding the review. Therefore the expression of CYP27b1 outside the kidney under normal circumstances begs the question why, and in particular whether the extra renal production of 1,25(OH)2D has physiologic importance. In this chapter this question will be discussed. First we discuss the sites for extra renal 1,25(OH)2D production. This is followed by a discussion of the regulation of CYP27b1 expression and activity in extra renal tissues, pointing out that such regulation is tissue specific and different from that of CYP27b1 in the kidney. Finally the physiologic significance of extra renal 1,25(OH)2D3 production is examined, with special focus on the role of CYP27b1 in regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation, hormone secretion, and immune function. At this point the data do not clearly demonstrate an essential role for CYP27b1 expression in any tissue outside the kidney, but several examples pointing in this direction are provided. With the availability of the mouse enabling tissue specific deletion of CYP27b1, the role of extra renal CYP27b1 expression in normal and pathologic states can now be addressed definitively.","

Correlation of quality of life with risk factors for first-incident hip fracture in postmenopausal women,"['walking aid', 'diuretic agent', 'age', 'aged', 'article', 'body height', 'bone density', 'case control study', 'controlled study', 'correlational study', 'disease association', 'dual energy X ray absorptiometry', 'estrogen therapy', 'exercise', 'female', 'follow up', 'hip fracture', 'human', 'incidence', 'major clinical study', 'mental health', 'postmenopause', 'psychiatric treatment', 'quality of life', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'risk factor', 'Short Form 36', 'weight bearing']","Aim: The aim of this study was to identify the correlation between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and risk factors of first-incidence hip fracture in postmenopausal women. Methods: This case–control study included 99 postmenopausal women with first-incident hip fracture and 101 women without hip fracture who were matched according to age. Evaluation consisted of clinical factors, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density of hip and spine. Results: The mean age of patients with an accidental first-incident hip fracture was 78.0 years. Patients with hip fractures had significantly lower scores for SF-36 domains at enrollment and 4-month follow up compared with the controls. Mental health also deteriorated significantly 4 months after hip fracture. Aside from lower HRQOL, clinical factors, including increased body height, no experience with estrogen therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, use of walking aids, less weight-bearing exercise, and diuretics use, were significant risk factors for hip fracture in univariate analysis. After multivariate adjustment, only the use of walking aids and decreased physical component summary were independent risk factors of hip fracture. Besides aging, use of walking aids, weight-bearing exercise, and psychological medication were the main factors affecting HRQOL when considering their relationship with hip fractures. Conclusion: The occurrence of first-incidence hip fracture is highly associated with HRQOL. Aside from aging, clinical factors affecting HRQOL correlated with hip fracture incidence. Thus, in elderly women, exercise or physical therapy to improve physical function and mental support is crucial and should be considered the most important factors for first-incidence hip fracture prevention.","

Methods: Pts with active RA (TJC ≥6, SJC≥6, hsCRP ≥3 mg/L) on stable MTX were enrolled and randomised 1:1:1 in a double-blind manner to once-daily (QD) UPA 15 mg or 30 mg monotherapy or to continue MTX (cMTX) at their prior stable dose. At BL, all pts discontinued prior MTX without washout and received PBO (for pts on UPA) or MTX at prior dose (cMTX) as blinded study drug. The primary endpoints at Week (Wk) 14 were the proportion of pts achieving ACR20, and the proportion achieving DAS28-CRP≤3.2 (NRI). Results: 648 pts were randomised, all received study drug; 598 (92.3%) completed 14 wks. BL demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar across arms. Both primary endpoints were met (p<0.001); at Wk 14, a significantly greater proportion of pts receiving UPA monotherapy (15 mg and 30 mg) vs cMTX achieved ACR20 (67.7% and 71.2% vs 41.2%), and DAS28-CRP≤3.2 (44.7% and 53.0% vs 19.4%) (table 1). All key secondary endpoints also showed UPA 15 and UPA 30 monotherapy to be superior to cMTX, including ACR50 (41.9% and 52.1% vs 15.3%), ACR70 (22.6% and 33.0% vs 2.8%), DAS28-CRP<2.6 (28.1% and 40.5% vs 8.3%), ΔHAQ-DI (-0.65 and-0.73 vs-0.32). ΔSF-36 PCS and ΔMorning Stiffness data are also shown (table 1). The proportion of pts achieving CDAI≤10 was significantly greater with UPA 15 and 30 vs cMTX (34.6% and 46.5% vs 24.5%). Adverse events (AEs) were reported at similar frequencies across arms; serious AEs were numerically higher in UPA 15 but similar between cMTX and UPA 30 (table 1). Numerically more infections were reported in cMTX and UPA 30 vs UPA 15. One serious infection each was reported in UPA 15 and cMTX, and none in UPA 30. Herpes zoster was more frequent in UPA 30 vs UPA 15 or cMTX. 3 malignancies (1 in cMTX and 2 in UPA 15) and 3 adjudicated MACE (1 in UPA 15 and 2 in UPA 30) were reported. One adjudicated pulmonary embolism was reported (UPA 15) in a pt with known risk factors (BMI 36; on oestrogen therapy). One death (haemorrhagic stroke due to ruptured aneurysm) was reported in UPA 15. No TB, renal dysfunction or GI perforation was reported. Rates and types of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with prior UPA RA studies to date. Conclusions: In this MTX-IR study population, switching to UPA as monotherapy at 15 mg and 30 mg QD showed significant improvements in RA signs and symptoms vs continuing MTX. Numerically higher responses were observed for UPA 30 mg vs 15 mg, particularly for more stringent efficacy criteria. Safety observations were similar to those in prior UPA studies.

One adjudicated pulmonary embolism was reported (UPA 15) in a pt with known risk factors (BMI 36; on oestrogen therapy). One death (haemorrhagic stroke due to ruptured aneurysm) was reported in UPA 15. No TB, renal dysfunction or GI perforation was reported. Rates and types of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with prior UPA RA studies to date. Conclusions: In this MTX-IR study population, switching to UPA as monotherapy at 15 mg and 30 mg QD showed significant improvements in RA signs and symptoms vs continuing MTX. Numerically higher responses were observed for UPA 30 mg vs 15 mg, particularly for more stringent efficacy criteria. Safety observations were similar to those in prior UPA studies.

Although these observations are controversial, progression of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) to RA in pre- and post-menopausal women is largely unreported. Objectives: Over a 10 year period, we followed patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) who were referred to rheumatologists and did not fulfil classification or diagnostic criteria for RA or other connective tissue disease. We studied the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in this setting. In this study, the primary objective was to determine whether HRT reduces joint pain and/or decreased the progression of UA to RA. Methods: From 2007 to 2016, 1076 patients (male:60, female:1016) classified as UA were referred to one of two clinics because of complaints of joint pains and were enrolled in this study. Beginning in 2012, premenstrual, perimenstrual and postmenstrual women with UA were prescribed ultra-low dose tocopherol (600 mg/day) and HRT. A reduction of over 70% joint pain on a p-visual analogue scale (p-VAS) was set as the criterion of a favourable outcome. Each patient was assigned into one primary disease category. For example, primary SjS was regarded as a disease category but if a patient had secondary SjS, they were assigned to the primary (RA, SLE, SSc) disease category. Results: During the 5 year observation period, 213/343 (62.1%) had postmenopausal arthralgia (PoMA), 46/112 (41.1%) with perimenopausal arthralgia (PeMA), 17/25 (68%) with premenopausal arthralgia (PrMA). In the RA patients, 10.2%, had RF alone, 73.1% (250/342) had ACPA and/RF or ACPA alone and 16.7% had neither ACPA or RF. The specificity of ACPA was 93.2%. Regarding efficacy of HRT, the incidence of RA in RF positive individuals was 9.1% (5/55) in patients undergoing HRT (current and past user), which was significantly lower (p<0.01) than the 48.4% (30/62) in those never treated with HRT. Likely due to low numbers in the cohort, the incidence of RA in ACPA positive females was 22.2% (2/9) in those receiving HRT was not statistically significantly lower than the 70% (7/10) in those with without HRT. Figure 1 Postmenopausal women responded to conventional HRT in 2013-2015 Conclusions: The progression of UA to RA is apparently ameliorated in RF positive females who received conventional HRT and oral E3 treatment. Although the numbers were smaller, a significant protective effect was not observed in ACPA positive UA females. because they developed RA before menopause. Our observations suggest that HRT in peri- and post-menopausal and oestrogen (E3) in pre-menopausal females with RF and ACPA positive UA may be important in ameliorating the progression of UA to RA.","

Several physiological, pathological and therapeutic conditions may change the serum oestrogen milieu including the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, elderly, chronic stress, altered circadian rhythms, inflammatory cytokines, use of glucocorticoids, oral contraceptives, and steroid hormonal replacements. Cortisol and melatonin circadian rhythms are altered, at least in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and partially involve also sex hormone circadian synthesis and levels. Abnormal regulation of aromatase activity (i.e. increased activity) by inflammatory cytokines production (i,e, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) may partially explain the abnormalities of peripheral oestrogen synthesis in RA (i.e. increased availability of 17-beta estradiol and possible metabolites in synovial fluids) and in systemic lupus srythematosus (SLE). In the synovial fluids of RA patients the increased oestrogen concentration are observed in both sexes and are more specifically characterized by the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, that is a mitogenic and cell proliferative endogenous hormone. Local effects of sex hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seems to consist mainly in modulation of cell proliferation. Epidemiological evidence indicates that during the fertile age women are more often affected by rheumatic diseases than men, particularly autoimmune diseases. As a matter of fact, rheumatic disorders with autoimmune involvement such as RA or SLE, result from the combination of several predisposing factors, that include the relationships between epitopes of the trigger agent (i.e. virus), the status of the stress response system including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) and mainly the effects of the gonadal hormones (hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis - HPG). The pre-or post-menopausal serum sex hormonal status is a further factor influencing the rate of rheumatic diseases. It is therefore important, whenever possible, to evaluate epidemiologic data broken down into age (for example 10 year age band) and sex-specific group before making inferences. Obviously, sex hormones seem to play an important role as modulators of both disease onset and perpetuation and show circadian rhythms together with cortisol. Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors. Low concentrations of gonadal and adrenal androgens [testosterone (T)/dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEAS), respectively] levels, as well as reduced androgens/estrogens ratio, have been detected in serum and body fluids (i.e. blood, synovial fluid (SF), smears, salivary) of male and female RA patients, as well as in SLE, supporting the possible pathogenic role for the decreased levels of the immune-suppressive androgens. However, respect to serum levels of estrogens, interestingly they are not significantly changed which is in strict contrast to androgen levels in RA patients (reduced). As a matter of fact, sex hormones can exert also local actions (paracrine) in the tissues in which they are formed or enter the circulation and both T and 17-beta estradiol seem to exert dose and time-dependent effects on cell growth and apoptosis. These effects, as well as important influences on gene promoter of Th1/Th2 cytokines and the recently discovered increased SF oestrogen concentrations, might suggest new interesting roles for estrogens at least in RA. Finally estrogens exert important epigenetic actions on cell proliferation. Estrogens act as key factors in cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as cancer development and progression (prostate). The expression of oestrogen receptor (ER)-b appears to be lost during prostate cancer progression through hypermethylation mechanism. Epigenetic drugs such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZAC) and Trichostatin A (TSA) showed efficacy in restoring ERβ expression in prostate cancer cells. These observations highlights that the strategy of merging epigenetic and hormonal therapies might be beneficial also in inflammatory/autoimmune diseases (synovial tissue).","

Estrogen (E2) may therefore have intrinsic immune-regulatory properties that vanish with menopause. Fc sialylation is a crucial factor determining the inflammatory effector function of antibodies. We therefore analyzed whether E2 affects immunoglobulin G (IgG) sialylation. Methods: Postmenopausal (ovariectomized) mice were immunized with ovalbumin and treated with E2 or vehicle. Total and ovalbumin-specific IgG concentrations, sialylation, and Fcγ receptor expression were analyzed. Postmenopausal women with RA receiving hormone replacement therapy, including E2, or no treatment were analyzed for IgG sialylation. Furthermore, effects of E2 on the expression of the sialylation enzyme β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (St6Gal1) were studied in mouse and human antibody-producing cells. Results: E2 treatment significantly increased Fc sialylation of total and ovalbumin-specific IgG in postmenopausal mice. Furthermore, E2 led to increased expression of inhibitory Fcγ receptor IIb on bone marrow leukocytes. Treatment with E2 also increased St6Gal1 expression in mouse and human antibody-producing cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for the increase in IgG-Fc sialylation. In postmenopausal women with RA, treatment with E2 significantly increased the Fc sialylation of IgG. Conclusions: E2 induces anti-inflammatory effector functions in IgG by inducing St6Gal1 expression in antibody-producing cells and by increasing Fc sialylation.

This antibodies-related inflammation may abolish the normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis or may cause 'oophoritis' which in turn results in anovulation and diminished ovarian reserve (premature ovarian insufficiency).

Compared with non-ADT patients, ADT patients had similar risk of subsequent psoriasis with an HR of 0.95 (95% CI 0.63–1.45; P=0.816). However, a higher risk of psoriasis was observed in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors patients (adjusted HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.09–4.20; P<0.05). Conclusion: ADT use did not increase risk of psoriasis in patients with PCa. Further studies are warranted to assess the clinical significance.","

Purpose: Low compliance to anti-osteoporosis medications (AOM) has been previously reported. We aimed to estimate 1-year cessation rates of different AOMs as used in Spanish healthcare settings, and to identify associated risk factors. Methods: A cohort study was performed using primary care records data (BIFAP). Patients entered the cohort when aged 50 years in 2001–2013, with ≥1 year of data available, and identified as incident users of AOM (1-year washout). Participants were divided into six cohorts: alendronate, other oral bisphosphonates, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, and denosumab. Patients were followed from therapy initiation to the earliest of cessation (90-day refill gap), switching (to alternative AOM), loss to follow-up, death, or end of 2013. One-year therapy cessation was estimated using life tables. Hazard ratios (of cessation) according to age, sex, lifestyle factors, morbidity, and co-medication were estimated after stepwise backwards selection. Results: A total of 95,057 AOM users were identified (91% women; mean age 68). One-year cessation was 51% overall, highest for strontium ranelate (68%), and lowest for denosumab (28%). Cessation probability was higher in men (14% to 2.1-fold), smokers (>6%), and patients with missing BMI (19–28%) or smoking (6–20%) data, and overweight/obese/underweight (7% to 2.6-fold increase compared to normal weight). Patients aged 60–79 years, with a recent fracture or other drugs used for osteoporosis, had better persistence. Conclusions: Over half of the patients initiating AOM stopped therapy within the first year after initiation. The described risk factors for cessation could be proxies for non-severe osteoporosis, and/or disease/risk awareness, which could inform the targeting of high-risk patients for monitoring and/or interventions aimed at improving persistence.","

Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data describing the optimal approach to removing foreign bodies from the bladder. Shirodkar cerclage placement requires dissecting the bladder and posterior culde-sac peritoneum off the cervix prior to placing either permanent sutures or a 5-mm Mersilene tape. The cerclage may be left in place if the patient desires a cesarean section and plans future pregnancy. However, strong consideration should be given to removal when childbearing is no longer desired. CASE: We present a patient with surgical tape erosion into the bladder 28 years after Shirodkar cerclage placement and then describe our minimally invasive approach for removing this tape.

Estrogen modulates immune-related processes such as T cell differentiation and cytokine production. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the role of estrogen in the disease activity of spondyloarthritis (SpA). The effect of estrogen on the inflammatory cytokines was evaluated. Methods: The effects of estrogen on the development of arthritis were evaluated by performing an ovariectomy and E2 pellet implantation in the zymosan-treated SKG mouse. Clinical arthritis scores were measured and PET-CT was performed to quantify joint inflammation. Total RNA was extracted from the hindpaws and forepaws and the expression of TNFα, IL-6, IFNγ, IL-4, IL-17A, IL-23, Dkk1, and SOST was measured by QuantiGene 2.0 plex assay. Results: Zymosan exposure triggered SpA-like diseases in SKG mice, including peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, dactylitis, enteritis, and psoriatic skin lesions. E2-treated mice showed remarkable suppression of arthritis clinically and little infiltration of inflammatory cells in the Achilles tendon and intervertebral disc. 18F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in the E2-treated mice. The expression of TNFα, IFNγ, IL-17A, Dkk1, and SOST was significantly reduced in E2-treated mice compared with sham and ovariectomized mice. Conclusions: Estrogen suppressed arthritis development in SpA model of SKG mouse. Results of the study suggest that estrogen may have an anti-inflammatory effect on the disease activity of SpA.","

Sex hormones are thought to play a role in the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases [2]. Objectives: We report 3 cases of SSc in male-to-female transsexuals diagnosed following their male-to-female transition Methods: Medical records of 3 patients diagnosed with SSc after male-to-female transition were reviewed. Disease features, hormonal therapies and surgical interventions related to gender reassignment were collected. Results: At our tertiary University Hospital clinical service, 3 male-to-female transsexual patients were diagnosed with SSc following their surgery between May 1997 and October 2016. All 3 patients had started their transition before the onset of the disease and had not been diagnosed with any autoimmune disease before either starting the hormonal therapy required for the transition or before undergoing plastic surgery interventions. The first case was diagnosed with anti-RNA pol III +ve diffuse cutaneous SSc at the age of 35 yearsa year after the first surgical intervention for infected silicone buttock implants and approximately 5 years of hormonal therapy with combination of mestranol and norethisterone (Norinyl-1®). She experienced scleroderma renal crisis 2 years after the diagnosis and severe vascular involvement with frequent and severe digital ulcers (DU), Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pulmonary arterial hypertension and telangiectasiae. She required chronic dialysis and was treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), rapamycin, bosentan and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI). She eventually died 8 years after the diagnosis. The second case was diagnosed at the of 49 years, approximately 6 months following her gender reassignmentand 5 years after having started hormonal therapy initially with conjugated estrogen isolated from pregnant mares (Premarin®) and later with ethinylestradiol and gestodene (Femodene®). She developed ANA -ve, antiCCP antibody and rheumatoid factor positive limited cutaneous SSc/rheumatoid arthritis overlap syndrome and experienced severe DUs, RP, GERD, inflammatory arthritis and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). She was treated with MMF, PPI, calcium-channel blocker (CCB) and low-dose steroid therapy with good response. The third case was diagnosed at the age of 43 years, 2 years after having started triptorelin (Decapeptyl®) and oestradiol valerate. She had not undergone any surgical intervention prior to her diagnosis. She developed anti-PM/Scl +ve limited cutaneous SSc/myositis overlap syndrome and experienced RP, GERD and PF. She has only been treated with PPI and CCB prior to her reconstructive surgery. Conclusions: Although still debated, the role of sex hormones in triggering autoimmunity has been suggested in animal models and human studies [2]. The development of SSc in our case series supports the notion that altered profile of sex hormones may modulate autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals with distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics.","

Results: At our tertiary University Hospital clinical service, 3 male-to-female transsexual patients were diagnosed with SSc following their surgery between May 1997 and October 2016. All 3 patients had started their transition before the onset of the disease and had not been diagnosed with any autoimmune disease before either starting the hormonal therapy required for the transition or before undergoing plastic surgery interventions. The first case was diagnosed with anti-RNA pol III +ve diffuse cutaneous SSc at the age of 35 yearsa year after the first surgical intervention for infected silicone buttock implants and approximately 5 years of hormonal therapy with combination of mestranol and norethisterone (Norinyl-1®). She experienced scleroderma renal crisis 2 years after the diagnosis and severe vascular involvement with frequent and severe digital ulcers (DU), Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pulmonary arterial hypertension and telangiectasiae. She required chronic dialysis and was treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), rapamycin, bosentan and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI). She eventually died 8 years after the diagnosis. The second case was diagnosed at the of 49 years, approximately 6 months following her gender reassignmentand 5 years after having started hormonal therapy initially with conjugated estrogen isolated from pregnant mares (Premarin®) and later with ethinylestradiol and gestodene (Femodene®). She developed ANA -ve, antiCCP antibody and rheumatoid factor positive limited cutaneous SSc/rheumatoid arthritis overlap syndrome and experienced severe DUs, RP, GERD, inflammatory arthritis and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). She was treated with MMF, PPI, calcium-channel blocker (CCB) and low-dose steroid therapy with good response. The third case was diagnosed at the age of 43 years, 2 years after having started triptorelin (Decapeptyl®) and oestradiol valerate. She had not undergone any surgical intervention prior to her diagnosis. She developed anti-PM/Scl +ve limited cutaneous SSc/myositis overlap syndrome and experienced RP, GERD and PF. She has only been treated with PPI and CCB prior to her reconstructive surgery. Conclusions: Although still debated, the role of sex hormones in triggering autoimmunity has been suggested in animal models and human studies [2]. The development of SSc in our case series supports the notion that altered profile of sex hormones may modulate autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals with distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics.

Three years prior she had undergone preventive bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO) after her mother died from ovarian cancer and her aunt died from breast cancer. Both were diagnosed after age 50. Postoperative estrogen suppletion was not considered optional by her caregivers. Unprepared for the consequences of the surgery, she was unable to work and developed feelings of insufficiency and regret. She had also developed osteopenia, high cholesterol, chronic migraine and analgesic-overuse and was referred for assessment and further treatment. Relevant findings at first assessment: G2P2; BMI 21.9 kg/m2; BP 110/70mmHg; glucose 5.9 mmol/L, total cholesterol 6.2 mmol/L, LDL-chol 4.2 mmol/L otherwise normal results. Medications: triptans, antihypertensives, vitamin, Calcium and magnesium tablets Greene Climacteric scale score: 33; CES-D (measure for depression) score: 52; MIDAS (migraine disability) score: 67 Questions 1. What would be optimal aftercare for Mrs M with regard to her physical, mental, psychosexual and bone health? 2. What non-hormonal options would be appropriate? 3. What kind of follow up would be advisable until what age? Case nr 2: Coronary artery disease after laparoscopic sterilization at age 34 and subsequent untreated POI in an obese woman with unhealthy lifestyle and family history positive for acute deaths A 59-year old woman Mrs V was referred because of persistent vasomotor complaints ever since laparoscopic sterilization at age 34. Her periods stopped shortly afterwards and she was diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) when trying to conceive a pregnancy for her younger sister of 2 years who also had POI. Mrs V also complained of mood swings, restlessness, fatigue, gastric pains and painful jaws and throat for which no explanation could be found. She avoided screening programs for cervical or breast cancer, was obese, smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day, had hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. She was being treated for a fractured ankle after she fell at work, did not exercise. Family history showed acute myocard infarction and death of a younger sister at age 52, and her father also died suddenly from cardiac arrest after age 60. Mother had rheumatoid arthritis and heart problems and died at age 70. Around this time Mrs V lost her younger brother when he was 31 years old and suffering from pancreatic disease. She stopped using her statins and oral contraceptive pills at age 38, tried MHT for a short while but was anxious because of possible negative consequences. Relevant findings at first assessment: G3P3; BMI 30.1 kg/m2, BP 170/100-110mmHg; glucose 6.6 mmol/L; total cholesterol > 9 mmol/L; Medications vitaminDand B12, Metoprololsuccinate Retard and Hydrochlorthiazide Greene Climacteric scale score: 23; CES-D (measure for depression) score: 27; Clinical course: Mrs V was seen by the cardiologist and upon catheterization (percutaneous coronary intervention) 5 stents were placed and lifelong use of anticoagulants and statins was advised. The procedure was complicated by massive bleeding in the left groin. She recovered, and almost all her unexplained symptoms disappeared. She refused to join the cardiac rehab exercise group, although she managed to reduce smoking to 5 cigarettes a day. Questions: 1. Is Mrs V a candidate forMHTfor persistent vasomotor symptoms and what would the best choice and for how long? 2. What would be the best approach to motivate her to adhere to screening and exercise programs and lose weight? Case nr 3: Obesity and vegetarian lifestyle in a 48-years old perimenopausal woman: strategies to manage vasomotor and urogenital symptoms and prevent development of cardiovascular complications A 48-year old woman Mrs B was referred for irregular bleeding, and vasomotor complaints. She was overweight, had hypertension, constipation, uterine myomas, overactive bladder signs and vulvar lichen sclerosis. She was a vegetarian and did not exercise. After treatment for lichen sclerosis and uterine myomas, removal of endometrial polyps, and insertion of a Mirena IUD, her vasomotor symptoms becamemore bothersome and her weight increased. She consulted the dietician and started a regimen low on carbohydrates and more wholesome on proteins and multivitamins. Upon weight loss most of her complaints were reduced and additional treatment for her vasomotor symptoms, overactive bladder or high blood pressure was no longer necessary. Relevant findings at intake: G3P3; BMI 31.1 kg/m2; BP 140/ 100mmHg Result after 6 months: BMI 28 kg/m2 and BP 140/90mmHg Questions: 1. Does Mrs B have cardiovascular risk factors of concern? 2. Does lichen sclerosis play a role in her cardiovascular risk profile? 3. What would be the best approach to motivate Mrs B to adhere to the diet and exercise program and prevent cardiovascular complications Case nr 4: Undiagnosed secondary amenorrhea in a 49-years old woman with sedentary lifestyle who developed urogenital syndrome and osteopenia: how to improve Qol and urogenital and bone health A 49-year old nulliparouswomenMrsGconsulted the gynaecologist because of vasomotor symptoms, recurrent bladder infections and dyspareunia. Her periods stopped at age 43 but the menopausal and urogenital complaints started just two years ago. She was normotensieve, did not exercise regularly and was recovering after 2 years treatment for 'burn-out'. Her mother's menopause occurred at an early age. Relevant findings at intake: G0P0; BMI 21.6 kg/m2; BP 110/75mmHg. Medications: Nitrofurantoine maintenance for chronic cystitis BMD Lumbar spine: 0.804 g/cm2 with T-score -1.8 and Z-score -1.1. BMD hip: 0.689 g/cm2 with T-score -1.5 and Z-score -0.8; suggestive of WHO osteopenia She started transdermal Estradiol suppletion combined with oral progestins at 3-months intervals and weekly vaginal estriol applications, also regular exercise. Repeat BMD after 6 years showed improvement of bone density and her urogenital complaints no longer needed maintenance antibiotics. Questions: 1. Is treatment indicated for secondary amenorrhea? What are the risks of untreated secondary amenorrhea 2. Is local treatment of urogenital syndrome preferred over systemic hormone therapy? Can these be safely combined 3. What would be the best approach for osteoporosis prevention in this case?","

Methods: We conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to date evaluating the influence of genetic variation on fracture risk, in 37,857 cases and 227,116 controls and conducted replication in up to 147,200 fracture cases and 150,085 controls. We leveraged the GWAS results to assess the role of 15 clinical risk factors on osteoporotic fracture risk using Mendelian randomization (MR). Results: We identified nine fracture loci. All loci were also associated with BMD and mapped to genes clustering in pathways known to be critical to bone biology (e.g. SOST, WNT16 and ESR1) and others identifying novel pathways (FAM210A, ETS2). We demonstrated that ETS2 is expressed in bone tissue and is involved in osteoblast differentiation. Among all 15 evaluated clinical risk factors, only bone mineral density (BMD) showed strong genetic correlation with risk of fracture (rg = -0.59, P=1×10-24 for femoral neck BMD). Similarly, our MR analyses indicated that a standard deviation decrease in genetically-determined femoral neck BMD was associated with 55% increase in fracture risk (OR=1.55 [95% CI 1.48-1.63]; P=1×10-68). Earlier menopause was associated with 9% increased fracture risk per standard deviation (OR=1.09 [1.03-1.14]; P=2×10-3). The remaining clinical risk factors (type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, age at menarche, vitamin D levels) evaluated through MR analyses showed no evidence for an effect on fracture. Summary and Conclusion: In the first large GWAS for fracture we identified genetic determinants of fracture that were associated with BMD. BMD was the only clinical risk factor, among those assessed, that had a major effect on fracture. These findings emphasize the importance of BMD as a central, yet insufficient cause of fracture.","

Methods: We conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to date evaluating the influence of genetic variation on fracture risk, in 37,857 cases and 227,116 controls and conducted replication in up to 147,200 fracture cases and 150,085 controls. We leveraged the GWAS results to assess the role of 15 clinical risk factors on osteoporotic fracture risk using Mendelian randomization (MR). Results: We identified nine fracture loci. All loci were also associated with BMD and mapped to genes clustering in pathways known to be critical to bone biology (e.g. SOST, WNT16 and ESR1) and others identifying novel pathways (FAM210A, ETS2). We demonstrated that ETS2 is expressed in bone tissue and is involved in osteoblast differentiation. Among all 15 evaluated clinical risk factors, only bone mineral density (BMD) showed strong genetic correlation with risk of fracture (rg = -0.59, P=1×10-24 for femoral neck BMD). Similarly, our MR analyses indicated that a standard deviation decrease in genetically-determined femoral neck BMD was associated with 55% increase in fracture risk (OR=1.55 [95% CI 1.48-1.63]; P=1×10-68). Earlier menopause was associated with 9% increased fracture risk per standard deviation (OR=1.09 [1.03-1.14]; P=2×10-3). The remaining clinical risk factors (type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, age at menarche, vitamin D levels) evaluated through MR analyses showed no evidence for an effect on fracture. Summary and Conclusion: In the first large GWAS for fracture we identified genetic determinants of fracture that were associated with BMD. BMD was the only clinical risk factor, among those assessed, that had a major effect on fracture. These findings emphasize the importance of BMD as a central, yet insufficient cause of fracture.

A 22-question survey was sent through the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) e-newsletter and social media, inviting females 13 years and older with psoriasis to complete an anonymous survey. In addition, a validated subset of 105 womenwhohad received care at the University of California, San Diego for psoriasis was contacted. 1652 womenresponded to the NPF invitation (31% response rate). 102 women contacted from UCSD completed the survey (97%).

About one-third of women reported worsening the week prior and the week of menstruation. Significant worsening during the post-partum period compared to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy was noted (p < 0.05). 78% of 682 women with multiple pregnancies reported the same response with each pregnancy, but 22% had a different response with at least one subsequent pregnancy. Most women reported worsening with menopause, while those who had or were currently on hormone replacement therapy found no change with HRT (p < 0.001). Worsening of psoriasis was more significant with progesteroneonly contraception (injectable shots, implants, and the Mini-Pill) than with combination contraceptive medications (p < 0.05).

Materials and Methods During routine posttransplant gynecologic evaluation, labial fusion was identified in 5 female patients. Clinical data were collected regarding underlying disease, transplant regimen, genital symptoms, systemic sites of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) and treatment, and follow-up. Results At presentation, women had a median age of 40 years (range = 35-50) and were 23-month to 8-year post-HCT.

Therefore, exogenous glucocorticoid administration in RA is recommended by EULAR and ACR from the beginning of the diagnosis, since may partially act like a ""replacement therapy"". In addition, the prevention/treatment of the night up-regulation of the immune/inflammatory reaction has been shown more effective when exogenous glucocorticoid administration is managed with a night-Time-release formulation. Despite a considerably higher cost than conventional prednisone (immediate release), chronotherapy with night-Time-release prednisone has been recognized a cost-effective option for RA patients not on glucocorticoids who are eligible for therapy with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Interestingly, since different cell populations involved in the inflammatory process are particularly activated during the night (i.e. monocytes, macrophages), other therapeutical approaches used in RA, such as conventional DMARDs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should follow the same concepts of glucocorticoid chronotherapy. Therefore, bedtime methotrexate chronotherapy was found to better manage RA symptoms, and several available NSAIDs (i.e. indomethacin, aceclofenac, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, lornoxicam) have been recently modified in their formulation, in order to obtain more focused night action.","

AB  - Morning symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are linked to circadian increase of night inflammation, supported by inadequate cortisol secretion in active disease. Therefore, exogenous glucocorticoid administration in RA is recommended by EULAR and ACR from the beginning of the diagnosis, since may partially act like a ""replacement therapy"". In addition, the prevention/treatment of the night up-regulation of the immune/inflammatory reaction has been shown more effective when exogenous glucocorticoid administration is managed with a night-Time-release formulation. Despite a considerably higher cost than conventional prednisone (immediate release), chronotherapy with night-Time-release prednisone has been recognized a cost-effective option for RA patients not on glucocorticoids who are eligible for therapy with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Interestingly, since different cell populations involved in the inflammatory process are particularly activated during the night (i.e. monocytes, macrophages), other therapeutical approaches used in RA, such as conventional DMARDs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should follow the same concepts of glucocorticoid chronotherapy. Therefore, bedtime methotrexate chronotherapy was found to better manage RA symptoms, and several available NSAIDs (i.e. indomethacin, aceclofenac, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, lornoxicam) have been recently modified in their formulation, in order to obtain more focused night action.

Itching is a sensation that results in scratching and rubbing, often perpetuating the problem. This presentation will focus on the common causes, recognition, and management. Diagnosis of the causative disorder can be difficult because the genital skin is moist, altering the classic skin patterns. Often there are two, three, or four concurrent conditions to sort out. For example, lichen sclerosus, contact dermatitis, candidiasis, and estrogen deficiency may co-exist. Vulvovaginal atrophy due solely to low estrogen often causes vulvar itch and burn. When present, it also compounds and confuses all other vulvar diagnoses. Topical estrogen treatment re-establishes barrier function. Candidiasis, the most common genital disease, is not as common in menopause and perimenopause but is an important consideration for patients on supplemental patch or topical estrogen, or who are immunosuppressed, diabetic, or using topical corticosteroids. Contact dermatitis is the most common cause of itching and irritation. This is usually due to hygiene habits, especially use of irritating cleansers, wipes and excessive friction from rubbing. It must be considered and eliminated in all itchy patients. When itching is overwhelming patients may choose to use caustic and irritating local anesthetics, resulting in more itch and a chemical burn. History is very important. Those not responding to standard treatment must be investigated for allergic contact dermatitis. Accurate customized patch testing will be needed. All the lichens will be discussed as they all are variably itchy. Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) is most important. It is the end stage of the itch-scratch-itch cycle in which relentless itching and resulting scratching results in thick indurated (lichenified) vulvar skin. It is often associated with other skin conditions such as psoriasis and irritant contact dermatitis. Management of LSC is the prototype for managing all vulvar pruritus. Treatment requires hydration, re-establishment of skin barrier function, control of infection, and stopping of all promoting factors. Topical or systemic corticosteroids are needed. Scratching is sometimes called 'itching' by patients. “I itch it” means “I scratch it.” This must be stopped with appropriate early and concurrent psychotropic agents. Lichen sclerosus (LS), the most common cause of chronic vulvar disease and scarring, is also itchy. This can be severe. It is recognized by the classic pattern of whiteness and scarring. Long-term (indeed lifelong) treatment with corticosteroid ointments is imperative. Lichen planus (LP) is ten times less common than LS and usually 'burns' or 'scalds' but can be extremely itchy. Recognition can be difficult. Usually there is a variable picture of combined erosions and scarring. Biopsies are often nonspecific. Psoriasis is often missed on the vulva because the morphology is atypical. It involves the hairy areas and the skinfolds in an atypical pattern which will be discussed. A commonly missed problem causing pruritus is cancer. Intraepithelial or invasive squamous cell carcinoma in some cases can be disproportionately itchy. Neuropathic pruritus presents with itch in normal skin. As in neuropathic pain there may be compression or degeneration of itch- sensing nerves. Trauma, radiculopathy or even central nervous system lesions like stroke or multiple sclerosis may be at fault. There may be a history of trauma to pelvis, back or hips. Often it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment requires gabapentin, tricyclics and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. Think multiple diagnoses, think mixtures of yeast and bacteria, think avoidance of chemicals and irritants, think hydration, think nerve damage, think ointments not creams. Think cancer.","

Although conventional treatments of RA commonly alleviate the symptoms, high incidence of adverse reactions leads to research tendency towards complementary and alternative medicine. As various medicinal plants are traditionally used for the management of symptomatologies associated with RA in Persian medicine, we reviewed medicinal literature to confirm their efficacy in the management of RA. Key findings: Scientific evidence revealed that traditional medicaments exert beneficial effects on RA through several cellular mechanisms including downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB, suppression of oxidative stress, inhibition of cartilage degradation with destructive metalloproteinases and enhancement of antioxidant performance. Various active constituents from different chemical categories including flavonols, lignans, coumarins, terpenes, glycosylflavons, dihydroflavonols, phytoestrogens, sesquiterpene lactones, anthraquinones, alkaloids and thymoquinones have been isolated from the medicinal plants. Summary: The pharmacological mechanisms of the medicinal plants traditionally used for RA in Persian medicine are discussed in the current review. Further investigations are mandatory to focus on bioefficacy of these phytochemicals for finding novel natural drugs.","

AB  - Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease, which affects synovial tissue in multiple joints. Although conventional treatments of RA commonly alleviate the symptoms, high incidence of adverse reactions leads to research tendency towards complementary and alternative medicine. As various medicinal plants are traditionally used for the management of symptomatologies associated with RA in Persian medicine, we reviewed medicinal literature to confirm their efficacy in the management of RA. Key findings: Scientific evidence revealed that traditional medicaments exert beneficial effects on RA through several cellular mechanisms including downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB, suppression of oxidative stress, inhibition of cartilage degradation with destructive metalloproteinases and enhancement of antioxidant performance. Various active constituents from different chemical categories including flavonols, lignans, coumarins, terpenes, glycosylflavons, dihydroflavonols, phytoestrogens, sesquiterpene lactones, anthraquinones, alkaloids and thymoquinones have been isolated from the medicinal plants. Summary: The pharmacological mechanisms of the medicinal plants traditionally used for RA in Persian medicine are discussed in the current review. Further investigations are mandatory to focus on bioefficacy of these phytochemicals for finding novel natural drugs.

The objective of this study was to determine if women with RA are using highly effective contraceptives, and if contraception differs by current medication use. Methods: Women with RA (2010 ACR/EULAR criteria) aged 20-40 seen in a university clinic without a history of ovarian surgery or prior exposure to possible ovary-toxic medications were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. The survey included questions on current medications taken for RA and contraceptive methods used in the previous three months. Contraceptive methods were categorized as highly effective (tubal ligation or vasectomy, IUD, Implanon/Nexplanon), effective (progesterone-only pill, estrogen-containing pill, Depo-Provera injections), and ineffective (abstinence, patient didn't think she could get pregnant, withdrawal, condoms, diaphragm, and none). Additionally, patients were asked if they had discussed contraceptives with their rheumatologist. Contraceptive methods were reported as counts and frequencies overall and in each medication class, and Fisher's exact test analyzed differences across medication classes. Results: There were 52 RA patients; 79% white with a mean age of 32 and mean RA duration of 9 years. Education beyond high school was completed by 98% of patients, 61% of patients were married, and 56% of patients worked full time. Discussing contraception with their rheumatologist was recalled by 71% of patients. Current medications included TNF-inhibitor (50%), methotrexate (48%), hydroxychloroquine (38%), NSAIDs (31%), corticosteroids (29%), sulfasalazine (15%), other biologics (13%), and other DMARDs (8%). In the 47 patients of reproductive age who were not trying to conceive, 38% were using ineffective, 34% were using effective, and 28% were using highly effective contraceptive methods (Table 1). Among 25 methotrexate users, 44% were using highly effective contraceptives, compared to 9% of patients not taking methotrexate (p=0.02). However, 24% of methotrexate users were using ineffective contraceptives. Among patients taking other DMARDs or biologics, drugs with very limited pregnancy safety information, 18% were using highly effective, 45% were using effective, and 36% were using ineffective contraceptive methods. Conclusion: In this highly educated group of RA patients, most women were using effective or highly effective methods of contraception. It appears that rheumatologists are targeting highly effective contraceptives to women who are taking methotrexate, a highly teratogenic drug. However, there is room for improvement for women taking newer DMARDs and biologics, for which we have inadequate safety data in pregnancy. (Table Presented).","

Whether the musculoskeletal symptoms can be attributed to an underlying rheumatologic disease remain unknown. Sporadic case reports have described the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who started therapy with tamoxifen or AIs [2]. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the population of patients with breast cancer treated with AIs. Methods: Data were collected from the administrative health-care database of Lombardy Region, Italy, from 2004 to 2013.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) provides information independent of BMD. Kidney transplant recipients had abnormal bone texture as measured by lumbar spine TBS, and a lower TBS was associated with incident fractures in recipients. Introduction: Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a texture measure derived from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) lumbar spine images, providing information independent of bone mineral density. We assessed characteristics associated with TBS and fracture outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. Methods: We included 327 kidney transplant recipients from Manitoba, Canada, who received a post-transplant DXA (median 106 days post-transplant). We matched each kidney transplant recipient (mean age 45 years, 39 % men) to three controls from the general population (matched on age, sex, and DXA date). Lumbar spine (L1-L4) DXA images were used to derive TBS. Non-traumatic incident fracture (excluding hand, foot, and craniofacial) (n = 31) was assessed during a mean follow-up of 6.6 years. We used multivariable linear regression models to test predictors of TBS, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) per standard deviation decrease in TBS to express the gradient of risk. Results: Compared to the general population, kidney transplant recipients had a significantly lower lumbar spine TBS (1.365 ± 0.129 versus 1.406 ± 0.125, P < 0.001). Multivariable linear regression revealed that receipt of a kidney transplant was associated with a significantly lower mean TBS compared to controls (−0.0369, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] −0.0537 to −0.0202). TBS was associated with fractures independent of the Fracture Risk Assessment score including BMD (adjusted HR per standard deviation decrease in TBS 1.64, 95 % CI 1.15–2.36).

The plasma levels of 2ME2 may increase up to 1,000-fold during pregnancy and correlate temporally with the remission of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis symptoms. 2ME2 has also been shown to exhibit disease-modifying activity in autoimmune models of RA. The activity of 2ME2 in these autoimmune disease models suggests it may have potential efficacy for GVHD. Using the C57BL/6 into BALB/c GVHD mouse model, we found 80% of 2ME2-treated recipients survived in comparison to 20% of PBS control mice (P=0.004). Whereas control recipients had severe GVHD in the skin, intestine, liver, and lung, 2ME2-treated mice exhibited only mild changes in these organs, reflected in their significantly lower GVHD scores. On day 7 post-transplant, there was a significantly lower number of donorderived CD4+ and CD8+ subset in the peripheral lymph node and Peyer's patches of 2ME2-treated mice compared to that of PBS control recipients. The percentage of IFNγ+ subset of donor-derived CD4+ T cells was reduced in the spleen (26.5% vs 31.2%) of 2ME2-treated mice compared to the control recipients. The same trend was observed for IL-2+ subset of donor-derived CD4+ cells (26.5% vs 31.2%). However, the percentage of donor-derived IL-17+CD4+ cells in the spleen of 2ME2-treatment mice did not decrease in comparison of control recipients. The reduction of IFN-γ and IL-2 was also observed in the serum collected 7 days post-transplant. The results demonstrated that 2ME2 treatment inhibits Th1 polarization and reduces IL-2 production in GVHD mice. To investigate whether GVL activity was maintained in the presence of 2ME2 treatment, we used P815 leukemia cell line transduced with a lentivirus vector coding for firefly luciferase (FLuc) for bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Serial BLI images showed the rapid tumor growth in mice received P815 and bone marrow cells alone (P815+BM) with PBS or 2ME2 treatment. Images and photon flux showed P815 leukemic engraftment with significantly reduced signal and leukemia infiltration in mice received P815, bone marrow and splenocytes (P815+BM+SP) with or without 2ME2 treatment. The overall survival of P815-bearing mice was prolonged in the mice received P815+BM+SP compared to mice received P815+BM alone. The data demonstrated 2ME2 treatment appears to preserve the GVL activity against P815 in mouse model. Our studies have established the diseasemodifying activity of 2ME2 in mouse GVHD model, and thus raise the possibility for using this drug as a potential new therapeutic intervention for prevention or treatment of acute GVHD.","

AB  - GVHD is mediated by donor T lymphocytes against recipient antigen presenting cells (APCs) and tissues. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2, Panzem) is an endogenous metabolite that at pharmacologic doses exerts antimitotic and anti-angiogenic properties. 2ME2 has been well-tolerated and safe in phase I/II clinical trials targeting various tumor types. The plasma levels of 2ME2 may increase up to 1,000-fold during pregnancy and correlate temporally with the remission of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis symptoms. 2ME2 has also been shown to exhibit disease-modifying activity in autoimmune models of RA. The activity of 2ME2 in these autoimmune disease models suggests it may have potential efficacy for GVHD. Using the C57BL/6 into BALB/c GVHD mouse model, we found 80% of 2ME2-treated recipients survived in comparison to 20% of PBS control mice (P=0.004). Whereas control recipients had severe GVHD in the skin, intestine, liver, and lung, 2ME2-treated mice exhibited only mild changes in these organs, reflected in their significantly lower GVHD scores. On day 7 post-transplant, there was a significantly lower number of donorderived CD4+ and CD8+ subset in the peripheral lymph node and Peyer's patches of 2ME2-treated mice compared to that of PBS control recipients. The percentage of IFNγ+ subset of donor-derived CD4+ T cells was reduced in the spleen (26.5% vs 31.2%) of 2ME2-treated mice compared to the control recipients. The same trend was observed for IL-2+ subset of donor-derived CD4+ cells (26.5% vs 31.2%). However, the percentage of donor-derived IL-17+CD4+ cells in the spleen of 2ME2-treatment mice did not decrease in comparison of control recipients. The reduction of IFN-γ and IL-2 was also observed in the serum collected 7 days post-transplant. The results demonstrated that 2ME2 treatment inhibits Th1 polarization and reduces IL-2 production in GVHD mice. To investigate whether GVL activity was maintained in the presence of 2ME2 treatment, we used P815 leukemia cell line transduced with a lentivirus vector coding for firefly luciferase (FLuc) for bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Serial BLI images showed the rapid tumor growth in mice received P815 and bone marrow cells alone (P815+BM) with PBS or 2ME2 treatment. Images and photon flux showed P815 leukemic engraftment with significantly reduced signal and leukemia infiltration in mice received P815, bone marrow and splenocytes (P815+BM+SP) with or without 2ME2 treatment. The overall survival of P815-bearing mice was prolonged in the mice received P815+BM+SP compared to mice received P815+BM alone. The data demonstrated 2ME2 treatment appears to preserve the GVL activity against P815 in mouse model. Our studies have established the diseasemodifying activity of 2ME2 in mouse GVHD model, and thus raise the possibility for using this drug as a potential new therapeutic intervention for prevention or treatment of acute GVHD.",Included,Relevant autoimmune disease focus.

METHODS: The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Databases from 2008-2012 was used to identify patients for the study.

Only patients who had a 12-month period of taking no osteoporosis medication leading up to starting the new medication were included in the study.

The role of female hormones is controversial and their relation in the transition to systemic autoimmunity has not been studied. The aim of this study is to analyze the association between estrogen exposure and the development of systemic autoimmunity associated with RA. Methods: This is a cohort study of first degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with RA. Only individuals without clinical evidence of RA are enrolled and followed-up yearly with a questionnaire and lab tests. We included in this analysis to all participants with available anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) status (anti-CCP 2.0 or 3.1) and full information on female hormonal factors. The outcome was the presence of ACPA. The predictor of interest was the cumulative lifetime estrogen exposure (CLE). CLE score integrates a history of early menarche <10 years, high parity defined as 3 or more pregnancies, hysterectomy, hormonal therapy used ever and late age at menopause (>53 years). Based on the score, women were categorized as being low, moderate or high estrogen exposed. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression to analyze univariate and multivariate associations adjusting by age, tobacco smoking, alcohol and obesity. Results: A total of 668 women FDRs were analyzed, of which 32 (5%) were ACPA-positive. We found an older mean age in ACPA positive (54 years) compared with ACPA negative (45.1) FDRs. Other characteristics such as heavy tobacco smoking (>10 pack-years), alcohol consumption, obesity, shared epitope or rheumatoid factor positivity were balanced between ACPA positive and negative FDRs. Moderate and high estrogenic exposure categories by CLE score were associated to ACPA positivity, but without statistical significance. We analyzed individual components of CLE, from which high parity was found associated, OR 2.7 (95% CI:1.1-6.5). Other female hormonal factors were analyzed, postmenopausal status was significantly associated to the development of ACPAs, OR 3.3 (95% CI: 1.1-10.4). We found no significant association with breastfeeding, irregularity of menstrual cycles, ever use of oral contraceptives or early menopause (<40 years old). Conclusion: In women at increased risk of RA, the development of ACPAs is associated with postmenopausal status and high parity. No significant association with different categories of estrogen exposure and ACPA positivity was found. We plan to replicate these findings in a separate cohort. Further research is needed to explore the biological mechanisms behind our findings.","

We attempted to replicate and extend these results using electronic health record (EHR) enhanced cancer registry data that assessed specific AE therapies and also accounted for potential confounding by age, smoking status, and chemotherapy use. Methods: Using cancer registry and EHR data, we identified a cohort of BC patients who were newly diagnosed and treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1998-2011 and had no previous diagnosis of RA. Smoking status at diagnosis, BC treatments and RA at diagnosis and during follow-up were identified using validated EHR-based algorithms. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from a multivariate Cox model were used to estimate the association of AE use with risk of RA, controlling for age, smoking status at BC diagnosis, and BC chemotherapy use. Results: The analytic cohort of 9,244 newly diagnosed BC patients treated and followed at Mayo Clinic had a median age at diagnosis of 59 years (range 18-97); 32% were smokers; and 29% were treated with chemotherapy. During a median follow-up of 49 months (range 1-191), 19 patients developed RA. Compared to BC patients not receiving any AE therapy, those receiving AI monotherapy, but not SERM monotherapy or both SERMs and AIs, were at significantly increased risk of developing RA (Table). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the use of AIs for BC therapy, but not SERMs or SERMs followed by AIs, is associated with increased risk for development of RA, when controlling for smoking status and use of chemotherapy. While needing replication, these findings suggest a specific role for AIs in RA development and suggest pathways that could be targeted to prevent this potential treatment complication.

AB  - Background: The use of anti-estrogen (AE) therapies (selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs], aromatase inhibitors [AIs]) in breast cancer (BC) patients was recently associated with risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (J Rheum 2015;42:55-9). We attempted to replicate and extend these results using electronic health record (EHR) enhanced cancer registry data that assessed specific AE therapies and also accounted for potential confounding by age, smoking status, and chemotherapy use. Methods: Using cancer registry and EHR data, we identified a cohort of BC patients who were newly diagnosed and treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1998-2011 and had no previous diagnosis of RA. Smoking status at diagnosis, BC treatments and RA at diagnosis and during follow-up were identified using validated EHR-based algorithms. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from a multivariate Cox model were used to estimate the association of AE use with risk of RA, controlling for age, smoking status at BC diagnosis, and BC chemotherapy use. Results: The analytic cohort of 9,244 newly diagnosed BC patients treated and followed at Mayo Clinic had a median age at diagnosis of 59 years (range 18-97); 32% were smokers; and 29% were treated with chemotherapy. During a median follow-up of 49 months (range 1-191), 19 patients developed RA. Compared to BC patients not receiving any AE therapy, those receiving AI monotherapy, but not SERM monotherapy or both SERMs and AIs, were at significantly increased risk of developing RA (Table). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the use of AIs for BC therapy, but not SERMs or SERMs followed by AIs, is associated with increased risk for development of RA, when controlling for smoking status and use of chemotherapy. While needing replication, these findings suggest a specific role for AIs in RA development and suggest pathways that could be targeted to prevent this potential treatment complication.

Generally, when the acute inflammatory process is unregulated and become chronic, concomitant factors might induce malignant cell transformation in the surrounding tissue (1). Epigenetic perturbations together with important steroid hormone metabolic changes, have been found closely linked to the risk and severity in several chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases conditions, as well as in cancer. Among the mechanisms involved, are already recognized the cell proliferation that is also induced by endocrine mechanisms such as increase of specific peripheral estrogen metabolites or the increased angiogenesis and increased endothelin 1 (ET-1), that acts in synergism with various growth factors, such as tranforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) to potentiate cellular transformation or replication. In particular. aromatase, is frequently highly expressed in the tumour-bearing breast of women diagnosed as having estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumours, and resulting in dramatically increased local estrogen production to drive tumour progression. On the other hand, it is now evident that prostate is an estrogen target tissue, and estrogens directly and indirectly affect growth and differentiation of prostate (2). Indeed, the formation of catecholestrogen metabolites, that are capable of forming either stable or depurinating DNA adducts, can cause extensive DNA damage and finally disease-specific and cancer autoantibodies. In addition, an important role in both estrogen-driven immune response and cancer, seems to be related to the selection of microRNAs (miRNA), single-stranded non-coding RNAs. In fact, the recently detected selective regulation of miRNA expression in immune cells by estrogen, is indicative of an important role of miRNAs in estrogen-mediated immune diseases in particular in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (3). As consequence of their promoting effects on disease progression, the use of estrogens (oral contraception, estrogens replacement therapy, treatment of infertility etc.) should be avoided in patients with active chronic autoimmune disorders, in order to reduce the risk to potentiate the immune response and even to induce possible carcinogenesis. A prominent endocrine role for 1,25(OH)D3 (vitamin D) in peripheral estrogen metabolism and related cell proliferative activities was recently discovered. Calcitriol decreases the expression of aromatase, the enzyme that generally catalyzes the peripheral estrogen synthesis from androgens, both in normal and inflammatory conditions, as well as in cancer tissues (i.e. breast and prostate cancer), where the estrogen intracrine synthesis is increased (4). On the other hands, Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, TNFa) are also strong enhancers of aromatase activity, as reported in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis synovitis. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency seems to play a role in increasing autoantibody production by B cells, and seasonal vitamin D declines may trigger flares in RA patients, as recently shown. Calcitriol seems to exert an inhibitory effect of aromatase transcription by a direct repression via promoter II, as well as to exert an indirect effect, due to a reduction in the levels and biological activity of prostaglandins, especially PGE2, which seems a major stimulator of aromatase transcription. Recently, an enhanced growth inhibitory effect by combining calcitriol and aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer cell cultures was revealed. In addition, it was recently shown that calcitriol down-regulates the expression of estrogen receptors and thereby further reduces estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells, including the cell proliferative stimulus provided by estrogens. All together, these important new achievements suggest that the inhibition of estrogen synthesis and signaling by 1,25(OH)D3 and its anti-inflammatory actions might play an important role in the use of calcitriol for the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer at least (5). From the clinical side, the negative consequences of low serum 25(OH)D levels seem to support the vitamin D protective role in cancer.","

The primary outcome measure was worsening of disease within 1-18 months after starting AET based on one or more of the following: Increased tender or swollen joint counts, addition of new DMARDs, withdrawal of AET because of worsening pain/swelling, and new onset RA. The worsening could not be attributed to changes or discontinuation of RA therapy. All data were extracted from Rheumatology clinic notes within 1-12 months of starting AET. Laboratory markers for inflammation were not considered because they were thought to be influenced by recent cancer diagnosis Results: Fifteen patients were included in this analysis. Mean age was 59 years and median duration of RA prior to cancer diagnosis was 7.1 years. Old age and lung cancer were the cause of death in the 2 patients who expired. All patients but one had ductal carcinoma (in citu or infliltrative) with negative HER2 amplification. AET used included Tamoxifen (4), Anastrazole (10) and Lotreziole (1).

Nine of 13 with available serology were seropositive; 2 of them developed new onset RA within a year of starting. RA worsened in 8 patients (54%) after initiating AET: 2 had new onset disease, 1 with flaring after years of remission, 1 had to stop AET (Anastrazole), 2 had to add/increase DMARDs and 2 had increased number of swollen/tender joints on expert assessment. One of the patients who used tamoxifen developed new onset RA starting with knees involvement while the other 3 did not have worsening of their established RA. With the use of AIs; 63% had worsening including 1 new onset RA with anastrasole. Among those who worsened, symptoms started within 2-5 months in most patient except 1 with later worsening (18 months later). On comparing patients who worsened to those who did not; patients with worsening tended to be younger (57 vs. 61: P=0.55) and had longer duration of disease (8.4 vs. 5.6 years P=0.5). Conclusions: Our data suggest that use of AET may worsen disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as increasing the incidence of the disease. Young age and long disease duration for RA increased the trend for worsening. Our study is limited by the small number of patients.","

RA worsened in 8 patients (54%) after initiating AET: 2 had new onset disease, 1 with flaring after years of remission, 1 had to stop AET (Anastrazole), 2 had to add/increase DMARDs and 2 had increased number of swollen/tender joints on expert assessment. One of the patients who used tamoxifen developed new onset RA starting with knees involvement while the other 3 did not have worsening of their established RA. With the use of AIs; 63% had worsening including 1 new onset RA with anastrasole. Among those who worsened, symptoms started within 2-5 months in most patient except 1 with later worsening (18 months later). On comparing patients who worsened to those who did not; patients with worsening tended to be younger (57 vs. 61: P=0.55) and had longer duration of disease (8.4 vs. 5.6 years P=0.5). Conclusions: Our data suggest that use of AET may worsen disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as increasing the incidence of the disease. Young age and long disease duration for RA increased the trend for worsening. Our study is limited by the small number of patients.

Functional block of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-17 and TNFα by neutralizing antibody prevents bone loss in ovariectomized mice. IL-18 promotes IL-17 production and plays important role in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. However, its role in estrogen deficiency induced bone loss is unknown. IL-18 binding protein is a natural antagonist of IL-18 and reduces the severity of collagen induced arthritis. In this study, we have investigated the effect of mIL-18BP administration to estrogen-deficient mice on T and B cells, Th17/Treg balance and finally its impact on skeletal parameters. Material and Methods: Adult female Balb/c mice were taken for the study. The groups were: sham, Ovx, Ovx+mIL-18BP (0.5 mg/kg body weight). Treatment was continued for a period of 4 week with s.c. injection twice weekly. After 1 month, animals were sacrificed; long bones were collected for static and dynamic histomorphometry. Bone marrow was flushed out for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation. Cells were labelled with antibodies for FACS analysis. Serum was collected for ELISA. Results: mIL-18BP administration effectively inhibited Ovx induced CD28 loss on T cells and B lymphopoiesis. mIL- 18BP robustly inhibited the proliferation of IL-17 secreting Th17 cells with concomitant increase in CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 T regulatory cells. mIL-18BP treatment restored trabecular microarchitecture, preserved cortical bone parameters likely attributable to increased number of bone lining cells and reduced osteoclast activity. mIL-18BP treatment restored the levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine to sham level which were altered due to ovariectomy in Balb/c mice. Conclusion: Exogenous mIL-18BP administration provides protection against estrogen deficiency induced bone loss and has the potential as a therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.","

AB  - Objective: Crosstalk between immune system and bone has led to a new area of research called osteoimmunology. Functional block of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-17 and TNFα by neutralizing antibody prevents bone loss in ovariectomized mice. IL-18 promotes IL-17 production and plays important role in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. However, its role in estrogen deficiency induced bone loss is unknown. IL-18 binding protein is a natural antagonist of IL-18 and reduces the severity of collagen induced arthritis. In this study, we have investigated the effect of mIL-18BP administration to estrogen-deficient mice on T and B cells, Th17/Treg balance and finally its impact on skeletal parameters. Material and Methods: Adult female Balb/c mice were taken for the study. The groups were: sham, Ovx, Ovx+mIL-18BP (0.5 mg/kg body weight). Treatment was continued for a period of 4 week with s.c. injection twice weekly. After 1 month, animals were sacrificed; long bones were collected for static and dynamic histomorphometry. Bone marrow was flushed out for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation. Cells were labelled with antibodies for FACS analysis. Serum was collected for ELISA. Results: mIL-18BP administration effectively inhibited Ovx induced CD28 loss on T cells and B lymphopoiesis. mIL- 18BP robustly inhibited the proliferation of IL-17 secreting Th17 cells with concomitant increase in CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 T regulatory cells. mIL-18BP treatment restored trabecular microarchitecture, preserved cortical bone parameters likely attributable to increased number of bone lining cells and reduced osteoclast activity. mIL-18BP treatment restored the levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine to sham level which were altered due to ovariectomy in Balb/c mice. Conclusion: Exogenous mIL-18BP administration provides protection against estrogen deficiency induced bone loss and has the potential as a therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

We observed highly significant, cumulative dose-dependent increased OR of incidence of both SLE and RA following treatment with SERM (p < 0.0001). The odds of developing RA were also increased following AI therapy (p < 0.001), but there was a trend for reduced odds of SLE, though this trend did not attain statistical significance (p = 0.070 for 2-11 months of treatment and p = 0.254 for 12+ months of treatment).

There are several aetio-pathogenic factors that may cause premature ovarian failure including iatrogenic causes, genetic, autoimmune, infectious and idiopathic. The aim of this study was to identify the aetiological profile of women with premature ovarian failure presenting to Sultan Qaboos University hospital. Method: A retrospective medical record review was conducted from June 2006 to October 2012. All women diagnosed with symptoms and/or laboratory evidence of premature ovarian failure (follicle stimulating hormone ≥40 UI/L and less than 40 years of age) were enrolled in this study. Possible causes of premature ovarian failure were obtained and classified into main aetiological factors. Results: There were 90 patients during the study period, of which, 39 (43%) were following chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant. The second most common reason was idiopathic (n=29; 31%) followed by autoimmune diseases (n=8; 9%) and genetic disorders (n=7; 8%). Most chemotherapy cases (69%) were among the young age group, while in the older age group idiopathic was the commonest (48%). Conclusion: Compared to the world literature, the most common cause of premature ovarian failure in this study was chemotherapy induced, especially in young girls undergoing bone marrow transplantation. This is due to high prevalence of transplantable hereditary haematological disorders like thalassemia and sickle-cell disease in this part of the world. Current standard of care recommends cryopreservation of ovarian tissue to preserve ovarian function in young girls undergoing bone marrow transplantation for such disorders.","
