Dear Dr. Dominguez-Bali,

I added psoriasis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and allergy to keywords. Please find attached the records I have identified through searches on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Unfortunately, I was unable to access Embase for additional records. I am screening the identified records and excluding irrelevant ones. Of the Web of Science records I have screened so far, about 80% are relevant.

Should we register the protocol with PROSPERO?

Thank you for your guidance and support. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Bruce (Kuang-Ying) Chen
