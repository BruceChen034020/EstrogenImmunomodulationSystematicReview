AB  -  Background Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause. Risk factors proposed as important in the pathogenesis of SLE include genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors (1). Strong evidence implicates sex steroid hormones in the pathogenesis of SLE and other autoimmune diseases in human beings. Female gender is considered the strongest risk factor for the development of SLE (2), which incidence is 8 times higher in females than in males during the reproductive years. This difference in the susceptibility for developing SLE strongly suggests the influence of sex hormones. We have shown a significantly increased risk to develop SLE among postmenopausal women under estrogen replacement therapy compared with postmenopausal women who did not take such hormones; this increased risk was directly related with the length of use of such therapy (3). Lupus flares have been reported during periods of major sex hormone changes such as puberty, menses, pregnancy and postpartum (4‐7). Abnormal metabolism of estrogens yields an excess production of 16‐alpha‐hydroxyestrone in patients with SLE of both sexes (8), and low plasma androgens levels have been reported in women with active and quiescent disease (9,10). An association between SLE and Klinefelter's syndrome has been proposed (11). Estrogen receptors have been found on OKT8‐positive lymphocytes (12). Studies in animal models of SLE have also shown the relevance of sex hormones for the development and course of SLE. Studies in the NZB/W F1 hybrid mouse support the role for female hormones in the modulation of autoantibody production, development of renal disease, and death (13). Female NZB/W F1 mice have higher autoantibodies titers and die several months earlier than males. Treatment with androgens improves the survival and reduces immune‐complex deposits and development of renal disease in NZB/W F1 females (14). Prepubertal castration of NZB/W F1 males plus administration of exogenous estrogen causes a female pattern of lupus (15). In general, these studies consistently suggest an interaction between sex hormones and the immune system. In our Institute more than 1900 SLE patients are followed‐up regularly; 95 percent are female, and around 20 percent of them are postmenopausal. These figures reflect the increasing number of women with lupus who reach the postmenopausal stage due to their susceptibility for developing either early or premature menopause, along with the extraordinary improvement in their prognosis and survival rate. (16,2). Menopause entails the risk of developing vasomotor and other symptoms, as well as chronic conditions, e.g. osteoporosis. Hormone therapy, with estrogens alone or in combination with progestins, constitutes the most effective treatment for vasomotor and urogenital symptoms. Current guidelines recommend hormone therapy, at the lowest effective dose and the shortest time necessary (17). Considering the increasing number of women with systemic lupus erythematosus who become postmenopausal, the earlier age of menopause onset, and the co‐morbidity appended; we aim to evaluate the effects of hormone therapy on disease activity, menopausal symptoms, bone mineral density, lipid profile, and mammographic breast density in peri/postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus. Hypothesis Hormone therapy does not increase the risk of lupus activity exacerbation, and it is effective for the relief of menopausal symptoms and improves bone mineral density. Design and methodology Design: Double‐blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. Objectives 1. Determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on disease activity in peri/postmenopausal women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. 2. Determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy in the relief of menopausal symptoms, and on bone mineral density in peri/postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus. The risk of exogenous estrogens for developing systemic lupus erythematosus and disease activity is controversial. Women users of oral contraceptives (18) or menopause hormonal therapy are at an increased risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus than non‐users (3,19). While a high rate of flares in women taking combined oral contraceptives has been reported (6), recently, we and the investigators of the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) group have demonstrated that estrogen containing oral contraceptives did not increase the risk of activity exacerbation (20,21). Hormone therapy was safe, well tolerated, and did not increase the risk of lupus flares in observational studies (22‐24); however, the SELENA group detected a slight increase in the risk of developing mild/moderate, but not severe flares (25). We consider this study will help to identify the benefits and major adverse effects, associated with the hormone replacement therapy in peri/postmenopausal women with SLE, and to determine their efficacy in this unknown field. Previous similar studies Few studies have explored the influence of hormone replacement therapy on the activity of SLE. Arden et al. (22), conducted a retrospective study among 60 postmenopausal women with SLE including 30 women users and 30 women non‐users of HRT. The mean follow‐up was 12 months. There was no significant difference in any parameter measured including lupus activity. They concluded that HRT appears to be well tolerated and safe. Kreidstein et al., in a case‐control study (23), compared the incidence of lupus flares between 16 lupus patients receiving HRT and 32 controls. After 12 months of follow‐up, the authors concluded that the use of HRT in postmenopausal females with SLE does not appear to increase the rate of lupus flares. Mok et al compared the frequency and severity of flares in 11 patients who received HRT with 23 patients who did not. No significant increase in the rate or magnitude of flares couldbe demonstrated in patients who received HRT over a median follow‐up period of 35 months (24). Although estrogens have been avoided in SLE patients, recently it has been considered that the safety of estrogens in lupus is unsolved. The U.S. National Institutes of Health have funded what is considered the first clinical trial on the safety of estrogens for women with SLE ‐SELENA (Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment). This clinical trial will be conducted in 5 U.S. rheumatology centers. It is considered that "the results of the trial will provide scientific evidence to support physicians' decisions about the safety of providing oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to women with SLE" (21,25). Patients: One hundred and six peri/postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria (31), will be followed regularly, baseline,1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18,21 and 24 months, to assess SLE activity as well as efficacy, safety and acceptability of hormone replacement therapy. 3. Determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on lipid profile, mammographic parenchymal density in peri/postmenopausal women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. 4. Determine the incidence rate of major side effects of hormone replacement therapy in peri/postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus. Outcome Measures. Lupus activity: 2. Biologically inert placebo identical in appearance and packaging size to the active regimen. 3. All women will receive a daily supplement of 1200 mg of calcium carbonate and 800 IU of vitamin D (Caltratate D, Laboratorios Whitehall‐Robbins). Admission procedure Procedure for patients recruitment: In order to measure lupus activity, we will use a validated disease activity index, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) (26). The primary outcome will be global disease activity throughout the follow‐up period, estimated as the area under the SLEDAI‐curve (SLEDAI‐AUC). Secondary outcomes will be the incidence of lupus flares, the time to the first flare, changes in SLEDAI values from baseline at each follow‐up visit, and maximum disease activity. Lupus flares and severe flares are defined as an increase in the SLEDAI of 3 or more or 12 or more points, respectively, from the previous visit (27). The data will also be analyzed with the use of a new version of the SLEDAI (SLEDAI‐2K) (28), and a modified SLEDAI (SLEDAIm) that excludes microhematuria and pyuria because they may be associated with the treatment. We will also record lupus treatment, hospitalizations, thromboses, and deaths. Menopausal symptoms: Menopausal symptoms and depression will be assessed through a face‐to face interview, utilizing the Greene Climacteric Scale questionnaire (29) and the Beck’s Depression Inventory (30). The Greene Climacteric Scale will be administered at baseline, and the Beck’s Depression Inventory at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment. Bone mineral density: Densitometry of lumbar spine and hip will be performed at baseline, 12 and 24 months with dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry. In addition, blood and urine samples to measure biochemical markers of bone turnover will be taken at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Other measurements: Blood samples will be collected for estradiol at baseline,1,2,3,6 and 15 months; lipid profile at baseline, 9 and 21 months; coagulation tests at baseline,1 and 3 months; cervical cytology examinations at baseline, 12 and 24 months; mammography at baseline and at the last study visit in all the patients who would complete > 12 months of follow‐up. Criteria for the selection of subjects Patients will be selected from the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran. Eligible patients will be identified by a research assistant when they attend their clinical appointments as outpatients, and will be invited to participate in the study. Inclusion Criteria: (Eligible women will be those having any two of the following criteria) 1. Amenorrhea of 6 months or more. 2. Serum follicle‐stimulating hormone level of 30 IU/L or more. 3. Menopausal symptoms. 4. Age 48 years or older. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Women older than 65 years. 2. Severe lupus activity at baseline (SLEDAI score, more than 30). 3. Use of estrogens within 3 months of the screening visit. 4. Serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or more. 5. Hypertriglyceridemia 500 mg/dL or more. 6. Metabolic bone diseases. 7. Liver disease. 8. Untreated hyperthyroidism. 9. Recent thrombosis. 10. Malignancy. 11. Endometrial hyperplasia. 12. Undiagnosed uterine bleeding or cervical dysplasia Use of hospital records: Hospital records will be needed in order to complete patients' information related to dates of entry to the hospital, first criteria, 4 criteria, chronic damage, sociodemographic information, etc., not for lupus activity or secondary effects from the hormone therapy, which will be collected prospectively. Medical records use has been authorized by the appropriate hospital authorities. This authorization is implicit in the approval form the ethics committee. Description of the medications to be studied 1. Conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/day plus 5 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate p.o. for the first 10 days per‐month (Premarin and Cycrin, respectively, Laboratorios Wyeth). Subject allocation Patients who fulfill the selection criteria will be randomly assign to hormone therapy or placebo, using a computer‐generated randomization list. Patients will be allocated to the random numbers according to their entrance to the study, once they have been informed about the study and sign the acceptance form. The allocation will be done by a research assistant. All SLE patients will be identified from the lupus clinic. If the patient would accept to participate, she will be asked to sign the consent form and a study number will be assigned by the research assistant. Follow‐up procedure All patients will be evaluated in a standardized way at the same dates (± 7 days) by two independent specialists: a rheumatologist and a reproductive health specialist. Both evaluations will be done at baseline,1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18,21, and 24 months. Rheumatic evaluation: Each patient will be evaluated by a rheumatologist at entry and every follow‐up visit. The following variables will be evaluated. 1. ‐ General information: (basal evaluation). A standardized entry form will be filled‐out to every patient who enter the study. 2. ‐ Lupus activity: (every visit) This will be evaluated using the SLEDAI (26), a widely used and validated lupus activity index. A training session for the use of all indices will be conducted between both participating rheumatologists in order to reach agreement in their use and diminish inter‐observer variability. 3. ‐ Medications: (every visit) Use of medications will be recorded, both as a continuous (dose) and binary (yes/no) scale. The following medications will be recorded: steroids, azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, and chloroquine. Non‐steroidal antiinflamatory drugs will be recorded only as binary scale. Study treatment evaluation: After completing the rheumatic evaluation, each patient will be interviewed about the onset of symptoms since the previous visit by an specialist in Biology of the Reproduction, who will be unblinded to the treatment assigned. A standardized questionnaire for this purpose will be used. In addition, the investigator will perform a gynecological physical examination, and will evaluate the compliance to the treatment. The pharmacy personnel will dispense the study medications according to the randomization list. Women who do not attend their scheduled visits will be contacted by the social worker, and visited at home when it was required. Criteria for early termination of the study: A patient will be discontinued from the study whenever any of the following criteria would be present: 1. Development of severe lupus activity (SLEDAI > 30). 2. Development of any putative complication to hormone therapy (thrombosis, cholestasis, etc.). 3. Development of any other severe complications due neither to SLE nor hormone therapy. 4. Need prolonged immobilization. The decision will be taken after an special meeting held by the study's physicians. It is required an agreement between at least one physician from each of the participating departments (Rheumatology and Reproduction Biology). 3. ‐ We will be able to determine the incidence rate of secondary effect and the risk/benefit profile of hormone replacement therapy in peri/postmenopausal women with SLE. 4. We expect to publish our results in first line journals. 3.8 References. 1. ‐ Alarcon‐Segovia D. The Pathogenesis of Immune Dysregulation in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. A Troika.

Data management An entry form for each patient (original and copy) will be filled‐out at both reproductive health clinic and lupus clinic. On follow‐up visits, standardized forms (original and copy) will be filled for each patient at both clinics. The information of these forms will be entered (double entry) on a master processing file which will be updated once a week. All paper forms will be kept in special locked cabinets. Study investigators will be the only persons having access to this information in order to maintain absolute confidentiality. Data analysis Final analysis will be undertaken after 24 months follow‐up is completed in all subjects. Population for analysis: All those patients who enter the study will be included in the analysis. The analysis period will be from the basal evaluation until the last patient’s visit or the study ending. Statistical analysis: Lupus disease activity will be analyzed by between‐group comparisons of lupus activity as measured by the SLEDAI‐AUC, maximum SLEDAI, and change in SLEDAI score from baseline at each follow‐up visit. nalysis of the incidence of flares will be based on incidence‐density rates, with patient‐years of follow‐up as the denominator and with relative risk and 95 percent confidence intervals as the measure of association. For each patient, time will be calculated from baseline until the first flare, withdrawal from the study, end of follow‐up, or death, whichever is first. The probability of flares throughout the study will be calculated with use of life‐table analyses and the log‐rank test. Climacteric symptoms will be analyzed as the mean value of the Green’s scale score at baseline and at each follow‐up visit, between‐group and intra‐group. Bone mineral density will be analyzed as the mean value at baseline, 12 and 24 months, between‐group and intra‐group. The safety and acceptability of hormone therapy will be analyzed as the proportion of patients in each group who develop secondary effects, as well as the number who quit the study during the follow‐up period. Continuous variables will be compared using Student's t‐test, and categorical variables using chi‐square or Fisher’s exact test. Within‐group comparisons were made with use of the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. P values will be two‐sided. All analyses will be conducted by the intention‐to‐treat method. Safety Monitoring Committee: An independent Safety Monitoring Committee consisting of 2 rheumatologists, 1 epidemiologist/ biostatistician, and 2 endocrinologists, not participating as investigators will be established. The committee will meet every 12 months, or at any time if an unusual problem occurs, to review all unacceptable events as defined by the investigators during the planning phase, and determine whether they may be attributable to the treatment studied. The study will be stopped by the Safety Monitoring Committee if the number of unacceptable events reaches the stopping criterion. The committee will also review the interim analysis, with authority to stop the study if a significant difference (P < 0.01) was detected. Missing observations: We will try not to miss any data, however, because this study involves several variables it is expected that some of them will be missing. We consider the percentage of missing observations will be small and at random, due to the prospective nature of the study. Anyway, we will seek advice from a statistician on the best way to handle the problem Preliminary (Interim) analysis: Final analysis will be undertaken after 12 months follow‐up is completed on all subjects. Number of subjects and statistical power Sample Size: Monitoring study progress: Duration of project (table 1) Table 1.‐ Study's timetable 3.4 Project management Since we consider we will not have enough patients to detect any significant treatment difference earlier, a mid‐term preliminary analysis will be done at 18 months. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate if there is an important difference between the two groups related to disease activity or adverse effects. If there was a satisfactory answer to the main study hypothesis or an unexpectedly higher number of thrombotic events would be present in the hormone therapy group, the study will be finished. As a stopping rule, a two‐tailed significance level for SLE activity P < 0.01 has been established, or the presence of >3 thrombotic events in the hormone therapy group. If a P value between 0.01 ‐ 0.05 was detected in the interim analysis, a second analysis will be undertaken 9 months later with an identical stopping rule for both SLE activity and thrombosis. Preliminary analysis will be done by personnel from the Clinic Epidemiology Unit at our Institute, whom will be blinded to groups' coding. Results will be reviewed by members of the Safety Monitoring Committee. The result will not be informed to the research group, unless an indication for termination of the study would be present. On the assumption of a mean (+SD) baseline SLEDAI value of 5.43±5.04 (27), we estimate that the planned sample size would provide an 80 percent chance of detecting a difference in SLEDAI of 3 points or more (on a scale of 0 to 105, with higher scores indicating greater severity), at a significance level 0.05. With allowance for a 20 percent loss to follow‐up, the planned sample size was 54 patients per group. A monthly meeting will be held among all study participants in order to evaluate the study's flow, solving problems, evaluate intermediate outcomes, and reach agreements. Decisions not foreseen at the beginning of the study will be taken in those meetings. Minutes will be written in each of those meetings which will be filed in the research book.

Main problems anticipated 1. Meet study's subjects number. This is the main problem we face. Although we follow regularly around 1900 SLE patients, finding 106 peri/postmenopausal women who would accept to participate in the study after reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria remains a hard number to reach. However, every year about 200 new SLE patients come to our Institute. We expect to meet the necessary number to conduct the study. If we noticed we had a low number, we will invite lupus patients from other institutions to participate. 2. We do not consider we may have problems neither with the evaluation from rheumatology nor reproductive health clinic. Expected outcomes of the study The results expected from this study will provide light about several unanswered questions: 1. ‐ We will be able to determine whether postmenopausal hormone therapy affects SLE activity. 2. ‐ We will be able to determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on climacteric symptoms and bone mineral density in peri/postmenopausal women with SLE. 3. ‐ Sanchez‐Guerrero J, Liang MH, Karlson EW, Hunter DJ, and Colditz GA.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of different hormone therapies on cardiac repolarization in recently postmenopausal women with and without hot flashes. METHODS: We recruited 150 healthy women: 72 with and 78 without hot flashes. They were randomized and treated for 6 months with transdermal estradiol (1 mg/day), oral estradiol (OE) alone (2 mg/day) or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 5 mg/day), or placebo. Cardiac repolarization was assessed by measuring QT intervals, rate‐dependence of QT‐end interval, and T waves from 24‐hour electrocardiographic recording before and during hormone therapy, comprising a total of over 20 million QT‐interval measurements. RESULTS: Hot flashes were accompanied with shortened median T‐peak ‐ T‐end interval (at RR interval of 700, 800, and 900 ms; P = 0.040, 0.020, and 0.032; η = 0.35, 0.39, and 0.37; respectively) during the use of OE but not transdermal estradiol. In contrast, the addition of MPA to OE lengthened the maximal QT‐end (at RR interval of 500 ms, P = 0.016, η = 0.27) and the maximal T‐peak ‐ T‐end interval (at RR interval of 500 and 600 ms; P = 0.016 and 0.032; η = 0.25 and 0.22, respectively). These effects were not seen in women without hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Hot flashes predict beneficial shortening in cardiac repolarization during OE, but not if MPA is combined with OE. These data may provide one explanation for MPA‐related cardiac hazards in epidemiological studies.

AB  -  Objective: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of different hormone therapies on cardiac repolarization in recently postmenopausal women with and without hot flashes. Methods: We recruited 150 healthy women: 72 with and 78 without hot flashes. They were randomized and treated for 6 months with transdermal estradiol (1 mg/day), oral estradiol (OE) alone (2 mg/day) or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 5 mg/day), or placebo. Cardiac repolarization was assessed by measuring QT intervals, rate‐dependence of QT‐end interval, and T waves from 24‐hour electrocardiographic recording before and during hormone therapy, comprising a total of over 20 million QT‐interval measurements. Results: Hot flashes were accompanied with shortened median T‐peak ‐ T‐end interval (at RR interval of 700, 800, and 900 ms; P = 0.040, 0.020, and 0.032; η2 = 0.35, 0.39, and 0.37; respectively) during the use of OE but not transdermal estradiol. In contrast, the addition of MPA to OE lengthened the maximal QT‐end (at RR interval of 500 ms, P = 0.016, η2 = 0.27) and the maximal T‐peak ‐ T‐end interval (at RR interval of 500 and 600 ms; P = 0.016 and 0.032; η2 = 0.25 and 0.22, respectively). These effects were not seen in women without hot flashes. Conclusions: Hot flashes predict beneficial shortening in cardiac repolarization during OE, but not if MPA is combined with OE. These data may provide one explanation for MPA‐related cardiac hazards in epidemiological studies.

AB  -  This was an investigator‐initiated, multicenter, single‐blind, randomized placebo‐controlled trial of vaginal estrogen (delivered by estradiol ring or conjugated estrogen cream) compared to placebo cream. This study was conducted by the Divisions of Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery at three academic institutions. Potential participants were recruited from women receiving care for rUTIs in the clinics of each institution. Women were postmenopausal as defined by amenorrhea for >12 months, history of bilateral salpingoophrectomy, or in patients with prior hysterectomy defined as menopausal symptoms for >1 year or age >55. Participants had documented rUTI (three or more in one year or two in six months) by positive urine culture. Participants were excluded if they had undergone urologic surgery within three months of screening or planned surgery within one year of screening, had the diagnosis of painful bladder syndrome, history of UTI requiring the use of intravenous antibiotics or one oral antibiotic available for treatment based on allergies and resistance profiles, known etiology of infections (e.g. urologic stones, fistulas, fecal incontinence, catheterization or poorly controlled diabetes), urothelial cancer, or actively treated estrogen sensitive tumor. Participant enrollment was deferred in the setting of undiagnosed hematuria or vaginal bleeding, but enrollment could occur after negative workup for malignancy. Participants deferred enrollment if they used vaginal androgens, estrogens or progestins within six months or if they used medications or supplements known to prevent UTI (e.g. cranberry products, D mannose, prophylactic antibiotics, methenamine hippurate) within three months of enrollment, but could enroll after washout. Those with a remote history of estrogen‐sensitive tumor required approval by her oncologist or primary care physician. Participants were initially randomized to receive either vaginal estrogen (via estradiol ring or conjugated estrogen cream) or placebo cream in a 1:1:1 fashion and were told that there were placebo and vaginal estrogen arms, but were unaware that there was not a placebo ring. Participants were randomized to either conjugated estrogen cream at a strength of 0.625 mg/g dosed at 0.5g (0.312 mg) twice a week, estradiol ring containing 2mg of estradiol placed vaginally every three months by study personnel, or placebo cream which was an over‐the‐counter lubricant containing mineral oil, petrolatum, ceresin and paraffin dosed at 0.5g twice a week. If participants in any arm developed three UTI in the six‐month treatment period, they were unblinded. If on placebo, they were provided active study drug or if they were in the vaginal estrogen arm, they were treated according to the provider's clinical practice and their outcomes recorded for the remainder of the study. The primary outcome of occurrence of UTI was assessed at six months or the end of study blinding, whichever occurred first. In order to improve recruitment and assess long‐term compliance, satisfaction and efficacy, we offered open label use of estradiol ring or conjugated estrogen cream after unblinding until month 12 of the study. Clean‐catch urine cultures were collected when participants were symptomatic: fever (>38 degrees C), urgency, frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness. Women were asked to have all urine labs done at the parent site as per standard clinical practice. The primary outcome of the study was the presence of a UTI in the randomized six months. We also assessed rates of UTI over the course of the 12‐month study in all participants as‐treated. Quality of life (QOL) questionnaires were administered at baseline, six months or unblinding, and 12 months. Questionnaires included the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI‐20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ‐7), Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social Aspects of Aging Questionnaire (MESA), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ), Global Perception of Improvement (GPI) and Estimated Percent Improvement (EPI) rating scales. Baseline medical history and concomitant pelvic medicine diagnoses were also collected. Participants using a cream treatment were asked to keep medication diaries and return tubes for weighing at months three, six, nine and 12. Adherence was defined as presence of the estrogen ring or tube weights within 20% of expected at follow up visits. In addition, before unblinding, the participants were asked whether they believed they were on active treatment, placebo, or were unsure.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: Based on the hypothesis that high‐meat diets may increase breast cancer risk through hormonal pathways, the present analysis compared oestrogens in serum and urine by meat‐eating status. DESIGN: Intervention with repeated measures. SETTING: Two randomized soya trials (BEAN1 and BEAN2) among premenopausal healthy women. SUBJECTS: BEAN1 participants completed seven unannounced 24 h dietary recalls and donated five blood and urine samples over 2 years. BEAN2 women provided seven recalls and three samples over 13 months. Serum samples were analysed for oestrone (E₁) and oestradiol (E₂) using RIA. Nine oestrogen metabolites were measured in urine by LC‐MS. Semi‐vegetarians included women who reported consuming <30 g of red meat, poultry and fish daily, and pescatarians those who reported consuming <20 g of meat/poultry but >10 g of fish daily. All other women were classified as non‐vegetarians. We applied mixed models to compute least‐square means by vegetarian status adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The mean age of the 272 participants was 41·9 (SD 4·5) years. Serum E₁ (85 v. 100 pg/ml, P = 0·04) and E₂ (140 v. 154 pg/ml, P = 0·04) levels were lower in the thirty‐seven semi‐vegetarians than in the 235 non‐vegetarians. The sum of the nine urinary oestrogen metabolites (183 v. 200 pmol/mg creatinine, P = 0·27) and the proportions of individual oestrogens and pathways did not differ by meat‐eating status. Restricting the models to the samples collected during the luteal phase strengthened the associations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limitations of the study, the lower levels of serum oestrogens in semi‐vegetarians than non‐vegetarians need confirmation in larger populations.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Most women develop MS before menopause. Menopausal hot flashes can worsen MS symptoms, and could be relieved with hormone therapy. Our objective was to evaluate feasibility, tolerability and symptom response of Duavee® (bazedoxifene + conjugated estrogen) in a Phase Ib/IIa double‐blind randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: We randomized 24 peri/postmenopausal women with MS and symptomatic hot flashes 1:1 to Duavee® versus placebo. Evaluations occurred at baseline and 2 months. RESULTS: Groups were balanced for age (mean 51.2 ± 3.6 years), EDSS [median 3 (IQR:2.5, 4.5)], and MS duration. 21/24 participants completed the study. FEASIBILITY: Enrollment was protracted (34 months), partially due to concerns about hormone therapy safety. TOLERABILITY: treatment group participants reported greater satisfaction and fewer missed doses; one participant (placebo) developed new MRI lesions; liver function testing remained normal for all patients. SYMPTOMS: Hot Flash Related Daily Interference scale at 2 months was lower in treatment vs. placebo group [median (IQR) of 4 (0.5, 14) vs. 9 (0, 33)]. Between‐group differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Despite perceived benefits in MS, estrogens have perceived risks that represent a hurdle to enrollment. With appropriate education and screening of participants, the favorable study retention (87%) and treatment satisfaction observed in the current study support the feasibility of a longer, powered trial to evaluate whether a proven treatment for menopausal symptoms, Duavee®, could also improve MS‐related function in menopausal women with MS.

AB  -  The aim of our study was to compare the responses of heart rate variability (HRV) with two different types of hormonal substitution therapy (HT) in post‐menopausal women (cross‐sectional study) and to reveal an effect of HT shortly after beginning of its administration (follow‐up study). To elucidate the influence of menopause and effects of different protocols of a HT on autonomic control of heart rate, we evaluated the heart rate variability (HRV) in 5 groups: premenopausal women (n=140), postmenopausal women without HT (n=360), women on HT with conjugated estrogen only (n=168), women on continuous combined estrogen‐progesterone HT (n=117), and men (n=140). Frequency‐domain of short‐term stationary R‐R intervals was performed to evaluate the total variance, low frequency power (LF; 0.04‐0.15 Hz), high frequency power (HF; 0.15‐0.40 Hz), portion of low frequency power (LF%) and ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF). Significantly lower portion of the LF was found in premenopausal women [46.9 (+/‐2.7) nu] when compared to untreated postmenopausal women [54.3 (+/‐2.9) nu] and men [55.2 (+/‐3.0) nu]. Treatment by estrogen only was proved to decrease the LF% [40.1 (+/‐2.1) nu] while no effect on HRV was observed in women treated with combination of estrogen and progesterone [57.2 (+/‐3.1) nu]. Also the HF was lower in postmenopausal women [4.16 (+/‐0.16) ms(2)] than in premenopausal women [4.79 (+/‐0.22) ms(2)] and women treated with estrogen only [4.98 (+/‐0.25) ms(2)] while in women treated with combined hormonal therapy the average value [3.99 (+/‐0.21) ms(2)] did not significantly differ from that of untreated postmenopausal women. The follow‐up study also proved increase of high frequency power already after two months of estrogen substitution therapy [4.86 (+/‐0.14) ms(2) vs. 4.19 (+/‐0.15) ms(2)]. These results suggest that higher vagal modulation of heart rate that seems typical for younger women becomes after menopause similar to that of men. We also proved a positive shift of HRV parameters toward more beneficial values as for a cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women treated with estrogens but not in those treated by combined estrogen ‐ progesterone substitution therapy.

AB  -  Background: Estrogen therapy in early menopausal women decreases the risk of coronary heart disease and parenteral, but not oral, estrogen is reported to reduce blood pressure (BP). Progestogens are typically added to estrogens to prevent unopposed endometrial stimulation. The effects of progestogen on BP have been less well studied to date. This study was conducted to explore the impacts of micronized progesterone (MP4) combined with percutaneous estradiol gel (PEG) on hemodynamics in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. Methods: Fifty‐two postmenopausal women (aged 49–75 years) with systolic BP (SBP) of 140–160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90–100 mmHg were randomly assigned for 12 weeks to placebo (n = 16), estrogen therapy (ET) (n = 19) with PEG (0.1 %, 1 g./d), or estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT, n = 17) with PEG and MP4 (100 mg/d). The primary endpoint was ambulatory BP and the secondary endpoints were arterial stiffness as brachial–ankle pulse‐wave velocity (baPWV) and aortic parameters on applanation tonometry. Results: One woman in the ET group dropped out, so 51 participants were finally analyzed. Outcome measures for ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness were not different between groups. Within‐group comparisons showed that EPT significantly decreased daytime heart rate and baPWV: the changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation) were − 2.5 ± 5.7 bpm (P = 0.03) and − 0.6 ± 1.4 m/s (P = 0.04), respectively. After adjusting for baseline, linear regression analysis revealed a significant difference in the relationship between baseline and 12‐week baPWV among groups (P = 0.02). The relationship was significantly different between placebo and ET (P = 0.03) and EPT (P = 0.01), respectively, but not between ET and EPT. Additionally, pooled results of active treatments disclosed that SBP, DBP, PWV, and augmentation index at the aorta were significantly reduced relative to baseline. Conclusions: There was no difference in ambulatory BP between ET and EPT in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. Further, ET and EPT similarly decreased baPWV from baseline as compared with placebo. MP4 might not adversely influence estrogen effects on ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Estrogen therapy in early menopausal women decreases the risk of coronary heart disease and parenteral, but not oral, estrogen is reported to reduce blood pressure (BP). Progestogens are typically added to estrogens to prevent unopposed endometrial stimulation. The effects of progestogen on BP have been less well studied to date. This study was conducted to explore the impacts of micronized progesterone (MP4) combined with percutaneous estradiol gel (PEG) on hemodynamics in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. METHODS: Fifty‐two postmenopausal women (aged 49‐75 years) with systolic BP (SBP) of 140‐160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90‐100 mmHg were randomly assigned for 12 weeks to placebo (n = 16), estrogen therapy (ET) (n = 19) with PEG (0.1 %, 1 g./d), or estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT, n = 17) with PEG and MP4 (100 mg/d). The primary endpoint was ambulatory BP and the secondary endpoints were arterial stiffness as brachial‐ankle pulse‐wave velocity (baPWV) and aortic parameters on applanation tonometry. RESULTS: One woman in the ET group dropped out, so 51 participants were finally analyzed. Outcome measures for ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness were not different between groups. Within‐group comparisons showed that EPT significantly decreased daytime heart rate and baPWV: the changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation) were ‐ 2.5 ± 5.7 bpm (P = 0.03) and ‐ 0.6 ± 1.4 m/s (P = 0.04), respectively. After adjusting for baseline, linear regression analysis revealed a significant difference in the relationship between baseline and 12‐week baPWV among groups (P = 0.02). The relationship was significantly different between placebo and ET (P = 0.03) and EPT (P = 0.01), respectively, but not between ET and EPT. Additionally, pooled results of active treatments disclosed that SBP, DBP, PWV, and augmentation index at the aorta were significantly reduced relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in ambulatory BP between ET and EPT in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. Further, ET and EPT similarly decreased baPWV from baseline as compared with placebo. MP4 might not adversely influence estrogen effects on ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness.

AB  -  Background: This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the only direct head‐to‐head comparison of letrozole and exemestane concerning suppression of serum estrogen levels in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Methods: In this cross‐over design study, 102 breast cancer patients were randomized into two cohorts for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Cohort 1 initially received letrozole (2.5 mg daily) for 3 months, then switched to exemestane (25 mg daily) for another 3 months. Cohort 2, conversely, started with exemestane and then switched to letrozole. Serum levels of estrone, estradiol, letrozole, and exemestane were measured using an ultrasensitive LC‐MS/MS assay. This enabled precise monitoring of drug efficacy, and provided invaluable quality control for drug adherence, a known challenge in endocrine therapy, ensuring accurate assessment of the therapeutic comparison. Results: Letrozole achieved superior suppression of serum estrogen levels compared to exemestane. In Cohort 1, which started with letrozole, estrone and estradiol levels significantly decreased from baseline to 0.2 pmol/L and 0.4 pmol/L, respectively, but increased after switching to exemestane. Conversely, in Cohort 2, which began with exemestane, letrozole further reduced estrogen levels upon cross‐over. Notably, while on letrozole, 94% of patients had estrone levels below the quantification limit, compared to only 35% when on exemestane. Serum drug levels confirmed treatment adherence and were correlated with the degree of estrogen suppression. Conclusions: This study conclusively demonstrates letrozole's superior efficacy in suppressing serum estrogens compared to exemestane during neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment. The findings indicate that the well‐documented lack of cross‐resistance between these drugs in clinical settings, allowing sequential therapy in MBC, is likely due to mechanisms beyond estrogen suppression. Our research group is currently investigating several additional, hithero unknown anti‐tumor effects during exemestane therapy. In the long run, our results may improve the selection of individual patients to the different types of aromatase inhibitors.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: In ovulating psychiatric patients experiencing suicidality, suicidal ideation (SI) often peaks perimenstrually. Our recent double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover randomized clinical trial (RCT; NCT03720847) showed that perimenstrual administration of estradiol and progesterone (EP) can prevent this peak in SI and depressed mood. In this pre‐registered follow‐up analysis, we studied how the menstrual cycle and experimental manipulation affected two neurobiological systems associated with the menstrual cycle and suicide risk: GABAergic neuroactive steroids (NAS) and peripheral cytokines. METHODS: In 26 psychiatric outpatients with natural menstrual cycles and past‐month SI, we analyzed serum samples from three blood draws (midluteal, perimenstrual, midfollicular) per experimental condition (EP vs placebo) timed to a luteinizing hormone‐surge ovulation test. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we measured the progesterone (P4)‐derived pregnane NAS (3α,5α)‐ 3‐hydroxypregnan20‐one (3α,5α‐THP), (3α,5β)‐ 3‐hydroxypregnan‐20‐one (3α,5β‐THP), (3α,5α)‐ 3,21‐dihydroxypregnan‐20‐one (3α,5α‐THDOC), (3α,5α)‐ 3‐hydroxyandrostan‐17‐one (3α,5α‐A), the androstane NAS (3α,5β)‐ 3‐hydroxyandrostan‐17‐one (3α,5β‐A), (3α,5α,17β)‐androstane‐3,17‐diol (3α,5α‐A‐diol), (3α,5β,17β)‐androstane‐3,17‐diol (3α,5β‐A‐diol), and their precursor pregnenolone. High sensitivity multiplex assay kits quantified peripheral cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐α. RESULTS: P4‐derived NAS fluctuated in parallel with P4 and increased with exogenous perimenstrual administration of EP. Conversely, androstane NAS either did not fluctuate or fluctuated inversely from P4, and these NAS decreased with exogenous EP. Peripheral cytokines did not show cyclical patterns, but each significantly predicted SI, depressed mood, or anxiousness. Concomitant SSRI medication use predicted lower androstane NAS. CONCLUSIONS: While preliminary and exploratory, our findings provide critical descriptive context for future studies. Further, our work presents menstrual cycle‐related patterns for ten frequently‐studied biomarkers, allowing for improved quality of comparisons involving naturally‐cycling populations in research.

AB  -  BACKGROUND Giredestrant is a highly potent, nonsteroidal, oral selective estrogen receptor antagonist and degrader (SERD) that was found to be well tolerated and active as a monotherapy and in combination therapy in Phase i/ii studies in early BC and pretreated locally advanced/metastatic BC (LA/mBC). Dual HER2 blockade with pertuzumab + trastuzumab (PH) + a taxane (induction therapy) followed by maintenance PH is the first‐line standard of care for most patients (pts) with HER2+ LA/mBC. Despite HER2‐ER blockade synergy, paucity of Phase iii data evaluating maintenance PH + endocrine therapy (ET) vs. PH in pts with ER+/HER2+ LA/mBC leads to variable use of ET in this setting. Adding giredestrant to the maintenance phase could improve outcomes. TRiAL DESiGN This is a Phase iii, randomized, two‐arm, open‐label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of giredestrant + the fixed‐dose combination of PH for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) vs. PH FDC SC after induction therapy with PH FDC SC + a taxane in pts with ER+/HER2+ LA/mBC. in the induction phase, pts will receive 4‐6 PH FDC SC cycles (1200 mg P/600 mg H in the first cycle, followed by 600/600 mg every 3 weeks) + a taxane (investigator choice of docetaxel/paclitaxel). Pts deriving clinical benefit may receive two additional cycles per investigator's discretion. Pts completing ≥4 induction therapy cycles, achieving at least stable disease, and with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% will be randomly assigned 1:1 to maintenance giredestrant 30 mg/day + PH FDC SC every 3 weeks or PH FDC SC only, until disease progression (PD). ET (aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen) will be allowed in the PH FDC SConly arm. Study treatment will continue until PD, limiting toxicity, death, or consent withdrawal. ELiGiBiLiTY Enrolled pts must have ER+/HER2+ LA/mBC, disease‐free interval from completion of (neo)adjuvant non‐ET ≥6 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1, LVEF ≥50%, and adequate organ function. Pts with prior SERD treatment or presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastases will be excluded. All men and pre‐/perimenopausal women must be eligible for a luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone agonist. AiMS The primary endpoint is investigator‐assessed, maintenance progression‐free survival. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate, ptreported outcomes, and safety. STATiSTiCAL METHODS The primary endpoint analysis will use a stratified log‐rank test at an overall 0.05 significance level (two‐sided). An interim OS analysis is planned, and an independent data monitoring committee will be in place. ACCRUAL The study is open for enrollment. Approximately 812 pts will be enrolled in the induction phase, to allow for approximately 730 pts to be randomized in the maintenance phase.

AB  -  BACKGROUND Endocrine therapies (ETs) that target estrogen receptor (ER) activity and/or estrogen synthesis are the mainstay of ER+ breast cancer (BC) treatment. Despite best management, ≤20% of patients (pts) with ER+/HER2‐ early BC (eBC) develop resistance (in some cases due to acquisition of tumor mutations in ESR1 that can drive estrogen‐independent transcription and proliferation) and still have high recurrence rates on standard ETs. New treatment alternatives for ER+/HER2‐ eBC are needed to reduce risk of recurrence and improve survival, tolerability, quality of life, and adherence. Giredestrant, a highly potent, nonsteroidal oral selective ER antagonist and degrader (SERD), achieves robust ER occupancy and is active against tumors that retain ER‐sensitivity or have ESR1 mutation(s). it has been demonstrated to be more potent in vitro and achieves higher ER occupancy in vivo than fulvestrant, the only currently approved SERD. Early‐phase clinical studies have demonstrated that single‐agent giredestrant (30 mg daily) has promising clinical and pharmacodynamic activity and is well tolerated in the ER+/HER2‐ eBC and metastatic BC settings. TRiAL DESiGN This is a phase iii, global, randomized, open‐label, multicenter study evaluating efficacy and safety of adjuvant giredestrant vs physician's choice of adjuvant ET (PCET) in pts with medium‐ and high‐risk stage i‐iii histologically confirmed ER+/HER2‐ eBC. Pts are randomized 1:1 to oral 30 mg daily giredestrant or PCET (tamoxifen, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, given according to prescribing information). Stratification factors are risk (medium vs high, based on anatomic [tumor size, nodal status] and biologic features [grade, Ki67, gene signatures if available]); geographic region (US/Canada/Western Europe vs Asia‐Pacific vs rest of the world); prior chemotherapy (no vs yes); and menopausal status (pre‐/perimenopausal vs postmenopausal). Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1, pts will be treated with giredestrant or PCET for ≥5 years. Continuing PCET after 5 years is at discretion of the investigator and per local standard of care. ELiGiBiLiTY Female/male pts with medium‐/high‐risk stage i‐iii ER+/HER2‐ eBC; prior curative surgery; completion of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (if administered) and/or surgery < 12 months prior to enrollment; no prior ET (≤4 weeks of [neo]adjuvant ET is allowed). For men and pre‐/perimenopausal women, a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist will be given per local prescribing information (mandatory for pts in the giredestrant arm). AiMS Primary endpoint: invasive disease‐free survival (iDFS). Secondary endpoints: Overall survival; iDFS (STEEP definition, including second non‐primary BC); diseasefree survival; distant recurrence‐free survival; locoregional recurrence‐free interval; safety; pharmacokinetics; pt‐reported outcomes. in addition, this study aims to improve health equity in research and expand clinical trial access. The study will also use/develop digital healthcare solutions, which will enable better understanding of pts' needs and their adherence to ET. STATISTICAL METHODS The primary endpoint analysis will use a stratified log‐rank test at an overall 0.05 significance level (two‐sided). An interim analysis and a futility analysis are planned, and an independent data monitoring committee will be in place. ACCRUAL 1018/4100 pts have been recruited globally.

AB  -  BACKGROUND Endocrine therapy (ET) modulates estrogen synthesis and/or estrogen receptor (ER) activity and is the mainstay of ER+ breast cancer (BC) treatment. ET + a cyclin‐dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) is the standard of care in patients (pts) with ER+, HER2‐ metastatic BC (mBC) in the first‐line setting. Fulvestrant ± a CDK4/6i, and everolimus + exemestane, are the current regimens approved for use in the second‐line setting. However, therapeutic resistance to some ETs, such as aromatase inhibitors, can arise from ESR1 mutations driving estrogenindependent transcription and proliferation. Current post‐CDK4/6i treatment options are suboptimal. New therapy options are therefore needed to reduce this risk and to improve outcomes, tolerability, quality of life, and adherence to treatment. Giredestrant is a highly potent, nonsteroidal oral selective ER antagonist and degrader (SERD) that achieves robust ER occupancy and is active regardless of ESR1 mutation status. While phase i SERD combination data in the post CDK4/6 setting is encouraging, there is no randomized combination data. Combining giredestrant and everolimus may potentially improve outcomes after CDK4/6is and in pts with ESR1‐mutated tumors; evERA BC is investigating this combination to address the unmet need in the post‐CDK4/6i setting. TRiAL DESiGN This phase iii, global, randomized, open‐label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of giredestrant + everolimus vs exemestane + everolimus in pts with ER+/HER2‐ locally advanced (LA)/mBC who had previous treatment with a CDK4/6i and ET in the LABC/mBC or adjuvant setting. Pts will be randomized to either giredestrant (30 mg) + everolimus (10 mg) by mouth (PO) every day (QD) on Days 1‐28 of each 28‐day cycle, or exemestane (25 mg) + everolimus (10 mg) PO QD on Days 1‐28 of each 28‐day cycle. Pts will receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Pts will use a dexamethasone mouth rinse four times QD for 8 weeks, started concurrently with study treatment. ELiGiBiLiTY Female/male pts ≥18 years with ER+/HER2‐ LA/mBC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0‐1, measurable disease defined per RECiST v.1.1 (or evaluable bone metastases with at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), disease progression ≥6 months after initiating ET + CDK4/6i in the LABC/mBC setting (and ≥4 months on most recent ET, if ET + a CDK4/6i was not the most recent therapy received), or relapsed either while taking or within 12 months of exposure to combination adjuvant ET (≥12 months) and a CDK4/6i (≥6 months). Availability of a baseline blood sample to determine ESR1 mutation status by circulating tumor DNA assay for testing at a central laboratory. Men and pre‐/perimenopausal women will receive a luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone agonist on Day 1 of each 28‐day cycle. AiMS Primary endpoint: investigator‐assessed progression‐free survival (PFS; per RECiST v1.1). Secondary endpoints: investigator‐assessed PFS in pts with detectable ESR1‐ mutated tumors in circulating tumor DNA at baseline; overall survival; objective response rate; duration of response; clinical benefit rate; patient‐reported outcomes; safety; pharmacokinetics. STATiSTiCAL METHODS The primary endpoint analysis will use a stratified log‐rank test at an overall 0.05 significance level (two‐sided). An independent data monitoring committee will be in place for safety. ACCRUAL Target enrollment is 224 pts globally, and this study is currently recruiting.

AB  -  Background: Three aromatase inhibitors (AI), the steroid exemestane, and the azoles anastrozole and letrozole, are effective in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer by preventing biosynthesis of estrogens including estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estrone‐sulfate (E1S) in postmenopausal women. OATP1B1, encoded by SLCO1B1, transports E1S into the liver for desulfation to active E1. Women carrying the low‐expression SLCO1B1 rs4149056 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have higher E1‐conjugate levels (Dudenkov Breast Cancer Res Treat 2017). We hypothesized that patients carrying this SNP would have increased E1S at baseline, and this E1S reserve could resupply E1 and E2 resulting in detectable estrogen levels during AI treatment. Methods: Five hundred postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to either exemestane 25 mg/day or letrozole 2.5 mg/day. Plasma estrogen concentrations were measured prior to and after 3 months of AI treatment using LC/MS/MS (LLOQ for E2 = 0.625 pg/mL, E1 = 1.56 pg/mL, E1S = 3.13 pg/mL). The additive genetic associations between rs4149056 and 1) log‐transformed concentrations of E2, E1, and E1S at baseline and 2) detectable ( > LLOQ) concentrations of E2, E1, and E1S after 3 months of AI treatment, were tested using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Results: Patients carrying the lowexpression rs4149056 (minor allele frequency = 0.18) SNP had 51% (per allele) higher baseline E1S concentrations (n = 438, 95% CI (29%‐76%), p < 0.0001). After 3 months of AI treatment, 15% (58/378) of patients had detectable E1; carrying rs4149056 increased risk of maintaining detectable E1 by 84% (per allele) (odds ratio = 1.84, 95% CI (1.08‐3.14), p = 0.025). Conclusions: Patients carrying a low‐expression OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 SNP have higher pre‐treatment E1S and greater risk of maintaining detectable E1 during AI treatment, possibly due to replenishment from E1S reserves. Further studies are needed to assess whether this common SNP is associated with increased risk of AI treatment failure.

AB  -  Therapeutic effect of tamoxifen (Tam) against ER+ breast cancer (BC) is known to be mediated by its binding to estrogen receptor‐alpha (ER /ESR1) and inhibiting estrogen signaling leading to altered gene expression. Besides this canonical mode of function, our pre‐clinical studies had revealed a novel mechanism wherein ESR1 directly binds wild type p53 (wt TP53) resulting in repression of its tumor suppressor functions, and Tam blocks this inactivation of TP53. Although patients with Luminal Tumors expressing wt TP53 are known to be more responsive to tamoxifen therapy, the underlying mechanism in tumors has remained unknown. To test the hypothesis that abrogation of the ESR1‐ mediated functional inactivation of TP53 is one of the major mechanisms that underlie the early effects of Tam therapy, we conducted a window of opportunity clinical trial in newly diagnosed luminal breast cancer patients undergoing surgical therapy. Methods: 59 women with ER+ invasive BC were randomized to 20mg Tam daily for 28 days prior to surgery or standard of care (SOC). TP53 status was confirmed by massively parallel sequencing. ER+ wt TP53 tumors were included in the study. IHC was performed on FFPE tissue from tumors to compare expression of ESR1 and TP53 along with their selected downstream targets. ESR1‐TP53 interaction in situ was determined by Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA).17β‐estradiol and Tam metabolites were measured in the plasma, tumor, and surrounding normal tissue using LC‐MS/MS. Global transcriptome analysis in tumors was conducted by RNA‐seq. Proteome expression in resected tumors was analyzed by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) with 216 proteins. Findings: Importantly, IHC on tumor tissues showed that the levels of ESR1 and TP53 were not altered in response to Tam therapy, whereas ESR1‐TP53 interaction was considerably disrupted by Tam (in situ PLA data). Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using DESeq2 R package followed by GSEA pathway analysis showed that 307 genes were differentially expressed (p< 0.05) (log FC>1.5) in tumors from Tam‐treated versus untreated patients in response to Tam therapy. Pathways representing TP53 signaling, stem cells, and low‐grade luminal breast cancer were upregulated in the Tam treated group while those representing adipogenesis, invasive breast cancer, estradiol response, ras signaling, and E2F targets were downregulated. “Master Regulators” identified by iRegulon included several p53 targets. Integration of RNA‐seq and RPPA data revealed that DEGs fall into three categories: (i) regulated by TP53, (ii) regulated by ESR1, and (iii) regulated by both TP53 and ESR1. Together, the data demonstrated that in addition to its conventional effects mediated by its binding to ESR1 and inhibiting estrogen signaling leading to altered gene expression, Tam disrupted the ESR1‐TP53 interaction leading to functional reactivation of TP53 and reprogramming of gene expression. Conclusions: Our data 1) support ESR1‐TP53 crosstalk in tumors as a novel mechanism underlying endocrine therapy response of luminal BC patients, and 2) highlight the importance of factoring TP53 into therapeutic strategies for ER+ BC patients, and 3) have implications in stratifying ER+ BC patients to those who will or will not be responsive to Tam therapy.

AB  -  Background: Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) may be the next important endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer. Enobosarm is an oral selective AR targeting agonist that activates the AR in breast cancer. Enobosarm has an extensive clinical experience in 25 clinical trials including in 2 phase 2 studies conducted in patients (pts) with AR+ ER+ HER2‐ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). An open‐label, parallel design phase 2 study, was conducted in 136 women with heavily pretreated ER+ HER2‐ MBC that were randomized to oral daily enobosarm at a dose of 9 or 18 mg. The primary endpoint of clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 24 weeks was 32% (9 mg) and 29% (18 mg). A post‐hoc AR expression subset analysis conducted in the ITT population with measurable disease at baseline revealed that the best overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in pts with ≥40% AR nuclei staining versus <40%, 34% and 2.7% respectively (p=0.0003) and the CBR at 24 weeks was significantly higher for ≥40% AR versus <40%, 52% and 14% respectively (p<0.0004). Overall, enobosarm was well tolerated with significant positive effects on quality‐of‐life measurements. Trial design: The ARTEST trial is an ongoing phase 3 multicenter, international, randomized, and open‐label study. Approximately, 210 pts with AR+ ER+ HER2‐ MBC and with AR nuclei staining ≥40% are being randomized 1:1 to either enobosarm 9 mg oral daily dose or an active comparator (physician’s choice of exemestane ± everolimus or SERM). Pts must have previously received a nonsteroidal AI inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for MBC and had a ≥ 6 months response to hormone therapy for MBC. The primary endpoint is imaging based progression free survival as measured by RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints on this study include the ORR, duration of response, overall survival, change from baseline in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and change in EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC‐QLQ).

AB  -  Background: The visual evoked potential (VEP) is a form of an electrical signal. VEP originates from the visual cortex which is located in Brodman areas 17 and 18 of the occipital lobe. VEP is generated in response to stimulation of the retina by light flashes or pattern stimuli. The advent of VEPs in the 1970s first allowed clinicians to assess neural conduction in the optic nerve. There are many factors that affect VEP such as age and gender; one among them is the hormonal factor. Ovarian and thyroid hormones are vital factors in the generation of olfactory, taste, visual, and auditory neuronal activity. The ovarian hormones progesterone and estrogen play a major role in the conduction of the optic nerve. Aims and Objectives: The aims and objectives of the study are to evaluate the influence of ovarian hormones in the VEPs. Materials and Methods: Among the 1st year medical students, 26 young females (18–20 years of age) were randomly selected. Informed consent was obtained from them and the institutional ethical committee approved the study. Students having regular menstrual periods for the past 6 months with normal visual acuity were included. Those with a history of polycystic ovarian disease, having irregular periods, under hormonal treatment were excluded from the study. Detailed history helps in identifying the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle. The P100 wave latency of VEPs was recorded during these two different phases. Results: An unpaired t‐test was used for analyzing the data. While comparing the proliferative and secretory phases, P100 wave latency was significantly reduced in the proliferative phase (101±3.6 vs. 97.9 ± 1.43 ms; P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The receptor sensitivity in the visual pathways to dopamine is increased by estrogen which in turn leads to a decrease in the time taken by the visual impulses to reach the visual cortex. Progesterone antagonizes estrogen activity in the central nervous system. Therefore, estrogen is responsible for the reduction in latency during the proliferative phase and progesterone is responsible for the prolonged VEP latency in the secretory phase. Thus, the excitability of the visual system is influenced by the ovarian hormones.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: (‐)‐Epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG) has preventive effects on obesity‐related precocious puberty, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to integrate metabolomics and network pharmacology to reveal the mechanism of EGCG in the prevention of obesity‐related precocious puberty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high‐performance liquid chromatography‐electrospray ionization ion‐trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐ESI‐MS/MS) was used to analyze the impact of EGCG on serum metabolomics and associated metabolic pathways in a randomized controlled trial. Twelve weeks of EGCG capsules were given to obese girls in this trail. Additionally, the targets and pathways of EGCG in preventing obesity‐related precocious puberty network pharmacology were predicted using network pharmacology. Finally, the mechanism of EGCG prevention of obesity‐related precocious puberty was elucidated through integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology. RESULTS: Serum metabolomics screened 234 endogenous differential metabolites, and network pharmacology identified a total of 153 common targets. These metabolites and targets mainly enrichment pathways involving endocrine‐related pathways (estrogen signaling pathway, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion), and signal transduction (PI3K‐Akt, MAPK, and Jak‐STAT signaling pathways). The integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology indicated that AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, STAT3, IGF1, and MAPK1 may be key targets for EGCG in preventing obesity‐related precocious puberty. CONCLUSION: EGCG may contribute to preventing obesity‐related precocious puberty through targets such as AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, STAT3, IGF1, and MAPK1 and multiple signaling pathways, including the estrogen, PI3K‐Akt, MAPK, and Jak‐STAT pathways. This study provided a theoretical foundation for future research.

AB  -  The unique biochemical profile of homocysteine is characterized by chemical reactivity supporting a wide range of molecular effects and by a tendency to promote oxidant stress‐induced cellular toxicity. Numerous epidemiological reports have established hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia‐type disorders, and osteoporosis‐associated fractures. Although combined folic acid and B‐vitamin therapy substantially reduces homocysteine levels, results from randomized placebo‐controlled clinical trials testing the effect of vitamin therapy on outcome in these diseases have generally fallen short of expectations. These results have led some to abandon homocysteine monitoring in the management of patients with cardiovascular or cognitive disorders. These trials, however, have generally included patients with only mildly elevated homocysteine levels and have not addressed several clinical scenarios in which homocysteine reduction may be effective, including the primary prevention of atherothrombotic disease in individuals at low or intermediate risk, or those with severe hyperhomocysteinemia.

AB  -  Background There is bidirectional interplay between PR and ER in human breast cancers (Lim et al, Endo Rel Can 2016). There is evidence for a reprogramming of ER chromatin binding sites with 470 genes differentially regulated by dual treatment with estrogen plus progestogen compared to estrogen alone in breast cancer cell lines (Mohammed et al, Nature 2015). Functionally, there was an additive anti‐cancer effect with the addition of natural progesterone to endocrine therapy in preclinical breast cancer models.

AB  -  Background Preclinical data suggest that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib) can delay endocrine resistance in breast cancer. A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase II trial investigated whether adding gefitinib (G) to anastrozole (A) would improve outcome in advanced breast cancer (ABC). Methods Postmenopausal pre‐treated hormone receptor‐positive ABC patients (locally recurrent or metastatic) were 1:1 randomized to A (1 mg/d) plus G 250 mg/d or plus placebo (P). Patients who had prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor in metastatic setting or with trastuzumab, anti‐EGFR or anti‐VEGF agents were excluded. Treatment was given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Progression‐free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.0. Results Of 108 planned patients, 71 were recruited (36 in A/G and 35 in A/P). The trial closed prematurely due to slow recruitment; 31 patients had prior chemotherapy and 53 prior endocrine therapy (all except one received tamoxifen); 60% in adjuvant and 16% in metastatic setting received tamoxifen; 59 patients had visceral disease. Median follow‐up was 18 months. PFS rate at 1 year was 35% for A/G and 32% for A/P arm. Objective responses were six (22%) in the A/G and nine (28%) in the A/P arm. Median duration of response was 13.8 and 18.6 months in the A/G and A/P arms, respectively. Fatigue (35%), diarrhoea (31%), rash (32%), dry skin (27%), and arthralgia/myalgia (27%) were the commonest adverse events in the A/G arm. Conclusions This phase II study, although prematurely closed, did not show a signal that adding G to A improves PFS at 1 year and its use is not supported. Gastrointestinal and skin toxicities were more pronounced with G resulting in premature therapy interruption in almost 1 in 3 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00066378).

AB  -  Background: For women with multiple sclerosis (MS), the menopausal transition can result in overlapping symptoms, worsening disability progression, and reduced quality of life. Observational data suggest that hormone therapy may improve physical functioning in these women. Objectives: To conduct a Phase II randomized controlled clinical trial comparing a tissue‐selective estrogen complex (Duavee®, bazedoxifene 20mg + conjugated estrogen 0.45 mg daily) vs. placebo in women with MS. Methods: We randomized 24 (peri)menopausal women with MS and excessive hot flashes 1:1 to Duavee vs. placebo. Clinical evaluations occurred at baseline and 2 months; a subset of 12 participants underwent brain MRI at both timepoints. Due to the planned low sample size, our pre‐specified power calculation was based on a “play the winner” approach, with 80% power to observe a greater mean change in the treatment than in the control arm. Results: At baseline, the groups were similar in demographic and clinical features, including age (mean 51.2 + 3.6 years), MS duration (median 10 (1, 32) years), EDSS (median 3 (1.5, 7)), Timed 25 Foot Walk, degree of cognitive impairment (SDMT), and MS treatment. Study retention was high, with 21/24 women completing the study. The treatment was well tolerated. Women in the treatment arm reported greater median Global Satisfaction on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication and fewer missed medication doses. Only one participant, in the placebo arm, developed new interval T2 lesions or gadolinium enhancing lesions in those receiving MRIs. The treatment group reported a greater change in EDSS severity (a median decrease of 0.5 (‐1.5, 1), compared to no decrease in the placebo group 0 (‐1.5, 1) and fewer menopausal symptoms at study's end, as measured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale: 4 (0, 37) vs. 9 (0, 57). All women in the treatment group vs. 5/8 in the placebo group experienced decreased daily and nightly hot flashes. None of these differences were significant, likely due to our small sample size, and are reported descriptively only. Conclusions: In this pilot study, we demonstrate feasibility of conducting a trial targeting menopausal symptoms in women with MS. Although retention, treatment satisfaction, hot flash and EDSS reduction all favored the treatment group, we had insufficient power to assess statistical significance. However, our encouraging results support an adequately powered trial assessing the efficacy of hormonal therapy for vasomotor symptoms.

AB  -  Objective: To determinate the effect of oral hormone therapy [HT] on the degree of oxidative stress [OS] in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. Design: A randomized, double blind controlled trial was carried out. We evaluated 46 postmenopausal women without metabolic syndrome [WOMS] and 44 postmenopausal women with MS [WMS] that were assigned to treatment [Tx] (0.625 mg/d of synthetic conjugated estrogens [Sixdin®] plus 5 mg/10d of medroxiprogesterone [MPA]) or (Figure presented) placebo [P]. Then we conformed four groups: Group 1: 21 women WOMS in Tx; Group 2: 25 participants WMS in Tx; Group 3: 25 women WOMS in P; Group 4: 19 participants WMS in P. We measured lipoperoxides levels [LPO] by TBARS assay as OS biomarker. Tests were carried out at the beginning and at 6 months of treatment. An alternative cut‐off value of LPO ≥0.320 μmol/L was defined on the basis of the 90th percentile of young healthy subjects. Results: Of the participants enrolled, 4 of each assignation group dropped out in different time, leaving 21 subjects in group 1 and 2; 22 in group 3 and 18 in group 4, who completed all the assessments (basal and 6 mo.). At basal time, LPO levels were highest in the women WMS (0.356±0.06 vs. 0.318±0.06 μmol/L, p<0.01). The proportion of women with high LPO levels were also higher among the group WMS (73% vs 48%) p<0.05.After 6 months of treatment, LPO levels decreased significantly in groups 1 and 2: WOMS 0.310±0.05 to 0.260±0.04 μmol/L (p=0.001), and WMS 0.335±0.06 to 0.298±0.05 μmol/L (p<0.05). In placebo groups LPO did not change. We found that the proportion of women WMS with high LPO at baseline reduced 40% using HT (p<0.05); in group 1 the women with high LPO also diminished 18% and in P groups these proportions did not change after 6 mo. (Figure). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that oral HT decreases LPO as an OS biomarker, but this effect is proportionally higher in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome than without metabolic syndrome.

AB  -  Background: There is bidirectional interplay between PR and ER in breast cancers (Lim et al, Endo Rel Can 2016). There is evidence for a reprogramming of ER chromatin binding sites with 470 genes differentially regulated by dual treatment with oestrogen plus progestogen compared to oestrogen alone in breast cancer cell lines (Mohammed et al, Nature 2015). Functionally, there was an additive anti‐cancer effect with the addition of natural progesterone to endocrine therapy in preclinical breast cancermodels. TrialDesign: This is a phase II multisite, randomised, open‐label, threearm, study in 200 postmenopausal women with early‐stage ER+, PR+, HER2‐negative breast cancer. Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive 14 days of intervention with either letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily (arm 1), letrozole 2.5 mg + prometrium 300 mg PO daily (arm 2) or tamoxifen 20mg+prometrium 300mgPOdaily (arm 3), between diagnosis of breast cancer and definite surgery. Australian Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN1261800092813 Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria 1. Histologically confirmed ER+ and PR+ breast cancers (≥10% positive staining cells). 2. HER2/CEP17 ratio of <2 and mean HER2 copy number <6 (ASCO CAP 2013 guidelines). 3. Tumour size ≥1cm on ultrasound and/or mammogram. 4. Postmenopausal (amenorrhoea 12 months, prior BSO, and/or FSH & oestradiol in postmenopausal range). 5. ≥18 years. Exclusion Criteria 1. Currently on hormone therapies (HRT and OCP). 2. Locally advanced/inoperable and inflammatory breast cancer. 3. Clinical evidence of metastatic disease. 4. Received other preoperative systemic therapies. 5. Nut allergy (prometrium contains peanut oil). 6. History of uterine cancer, DVT, PE or clotting disorder. 7. Pregnant/breast feeding. Endpoints 1. Primary Endpoint The geometric mean suppression of the centrally assessed proliferation marker Ki67, compared with baseline. Obtained by comparing the mean difference in Ki67 staining between pre and post‐treated samples. 2 Secondary Endpoint Safety and tolerability of combination therapy (NCI‐CTCAE v4.0) 3 Translational Endpoints Define a gene set as a predictive biomarker for a reduction in Ki67, evaluate changes in the apoptotic markers Bcl‐2 and Caspase 3 and evaluate changes in ER, PR, AR, FoxA1, Cyclin D1 protein and mRNA expression. Statistical Methods: The IMPACT study reported a geometric mean reduction in Ki67 after 2 weeks of preoperative tamoxifen of 59.5% and anastrazole of 76% (Dowsett et al, JNCI 2007). This allows estimation of power to detect differences between Arm 1 and either Arm 2 or Arm3 with a p‐value of 0.025. For the third possible comparison of Arm 2 versus Arm 3, there is no prior evidence, therefore this as a purely exploratory comparison. With a total recruitment of 200 and allowing 4% dropouts, this would give 80% power to detect an improvement in Ki67 suppression from 76% in the letrozole alone control arm to 92% in either experimental arm.

AB  -  Objective: Compare the efficacy of oral dydrogesterone to prevent LH peak during ovarian stimulation versus usual antagonist protocol in fertility preservation cases with oocyte vitrification. Design: Randomized prospective study from August 2019 to March 2020 at the Gynecology, Obstetric and Reproductive Medicine department of the Aziza Othmana University Hospital. Materials and Methods: Inclusion criteria: All patients underwent controlled ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation via oocyte vitrification. Exclusion criteria: Patients with hormone‐dependent diseases (breast cancer, systemic lupus). Random‐start ovarian stimulation was conducted with 300 IU of recombinant FSH for all patients. Patients were randomized into 2 groups on the day of the onset of ovarian stimulation: Group 1: prevention of LH peak using Dydrogesterone orally: 10 mg three times a day; beginning the first day of ovarian stimulation. Group 2: Prevention of LH peak by subcutaneous injection of Cetrotelix 0.25 mg per day from the first day of ovarian stimulation. Ovulation was triggered with 0.2 mg triptoreline. Oocyte pickup took place 37 hours later, either vaginally or per urethral transvesical route (for virgin patients). χ2 test was used to compare qualitative variables. Student’s t‐test was used to compare quantitative variables. P‐value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Forty‐seven patients were included in our study: 22 in Group 1 and 25 in Group 2. There was no significant difference regarding the clinical characteristics of the 2 groups (Group 1 vs Group 2) in terms of age (23.14 ± 5.07 vs 23.8 ± 5.7, p: 0.7), BMI (21.63 ± 3.6 vs 22.48 ± 4.03, p: 0.5), AMH levels (2.04 ± 1.24 vs 3.3 ± 1.93, p: 0.06), the duration of ovarian stimulation ( 9.14 ± 1.55 vs 9.33 ± 1.79, p: 0.5), the number of follicles with a diameter > 15 mm on the day of triggering ( 7.62 ± 4.1 vs 7.5 ± 3.3, p: 0.6) and plasma oestrogen levels on the day of triggering ovulation (2587 ± 1601 vs 2083 ± 1163, p: 0.1) Moreover, pickup results were similar (goupe 1 vs group 2) for the number of CCOS( 12.71 ± 7.7 vs 12.29 ± 7.6, p: 0.3) and the number of mature oocytes ( 9.85 ± 5.9 vs 9 ± 6.7, p: 0.9). It should be noted that LH monitoring was performed in all patients and the difference was not significant either. Conclusions: Prevention of premature LH peak during COS is possible using dydrogesterone in Random‐start protocols for fertility preservation, excluding cases of hormone‐dependant diseases.

AB  -  Background: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most common cancers among men and managed through surgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, and cryotherapy. Depending on the stage of PrCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly utilized as an intervention. ADT has proven effective in intervening in PrCa progression, although there are several side effects. Recently, the use of low carb diets has been shown to alter patients' metabolic phenotype and as such may reduce the side effects of ADT. Methods: In this study 35 men, who were beginning ADT, were randomized to low carb diet intervention with recommended exercise or control (no lifestyle change) for 6 months. Primary results have been reported showing significant weight loss at both 3‐month (17lb, p<0.01) and 6‐month (23 lbs, p<0.01) and improved insulin control at 3‐month (HOMA=‐19 as compared to baseline, p=0.02) but not at 6‐month (HOMA=‐4 as compared to baseline, p=0.13). For this exploratory analysis, sera collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months was used for metabolomics analysis utilizing GC/MS TOF, QqQ LC‐HILIC‐MS/MS, and TripleTOF 6600 LC‐RP‐MS and lipidomics analysis using TripleTOF 5600+ MS/MSALL workflows to quantify the chemical diversity of the metabolome and lipidome. Results: Over 450 metabolites and 1000 lipid species were quantified. Metabolomics analysis of sera from the control patients (ADT alone) demonstrated alterations in steroid biosynthesis, androgen/estrogen metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and lysine degradation. Lipidomics analysis of the control patients demonstrated changes in selective long chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine species. Analysis of the ADT plus low carb patients revealed a change in pyruvate, glucose‐alanine cycle, selenoamino acid, phenylalanine/tyrosine, and taurine metabolism. Further, lipidomic analysis revealed changes in several triglycerides, plasmalenylethanolamine, and phosphatidic acid species. Conclusion: In summary, integration of metabolomic and lipidomic analysis in hormonal and metabolic interventions of PrCa patients revealed dynamic changes providing novel insight for tailoring therapeutic intervention and monitoring.

AB  -  Background: Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used chemical in plastics production, has been shown to have estrogenic activity, although it is unclear whether BPA exposure alters effectiveness of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment among women with breast cancer. In vitro studies have indicated that at higher concentrations (≥10‐4 μM), BPA inhibits aromatase expression and activity, whereas at environmentally relevant concentrations (≤10‐8 μM), BPA increases aromatase expression and activity. Few in vivo studies have investigated the association between BPA exposure and estrogen concentrations among non‐pregnant women. This pilot study among post‐menopausal women receiving AI therapy evaluated whether BPA is detectable in participants' urine, and the association between BPA and hormone concentrations. Methods: This study was ancillary to a larger intervention study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01509079), and participants provided informed consent for this ancillary study under a protocol approved by the institutional review boards of Park Nicollet Institute/HealthPartners and the University of Minnesota. AI adherence during the 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit was monitored through weekly diaries. Participants were instructed to collect spot urine collections in sterile, BPA‐free polypropylene containers in the 24 hours prior to the baseline study visit. Serum hormone concentrations were measured using serum collected at the baseline study visit. The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ‐ Musculoskeletal Symptom (BCPT‐MS) scale was used to assess AI‐associated musculoskeletal syndrome symptoms at the baseline study visit. Results: Fourteen women agreed to participate in the pilot study, however one participant's data was excluded due to substances interfering with BPA measurement. BPA was detected in urine from all 13 remaining participants. Geometric mean urinary BPA concentration (1.55 mcg/g creatinine, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98‐2.45) was higher than concentrations reported for females (1.36 mcg/g creatinine, 95% CI: 1.23‐1.51) in the 2013‐14 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey biomonitoring data. Age, body mass index, and percent body fat did not differ between women above or below the study median urinary BPA concentrations (1.49 ng/mL). Women with BPA concentrations >1.49 ng/mL had consistently lower serum estrone (5.0 vs. 7.0 pg/ mL, p=0.15), estradiol (2.8 vs. 3.6 pg/mL, p=0.04), and testosterone (21.5 vs 23.8 ng/dL, p=0.28) concentrations compared to women with lower BPA concentrations. No statistically significant differences in BCPT‐MS scores were observed between women with higher vs. lower urinary BPA concentrations. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that BPA exposures may work in concert with AIs to lower serum estrogen levels. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings.

AB  -  Background: Large cohort studies have consistently reported decreased occurrence of breast cancer among women with RA. However, both the reasons behind this decreased risk and if it is present already before RA diagnosis, is unclear. The occurrence of RA following breast cancer is clinically and etiologically important also for other reasons. Long‐term adjuvant anti‐hormonal treatment with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors has become mainstay for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, but are often associated with arthralgia as a side effect. Some studies have suggested that these therapies not only induce arthralgia, but also inflammatory arthritis. Objectives: To examine the risk of incident breast cancer in women with RA, and the risk of RA in women with a history of breast cancer, taking anti‐hormonal treatment for breast cancer into account. Methods: Using nationwide Swedish registers, women with new‐onset RA diagnosed 2006‐2016 were identified. Each RA patient was matched on age, sex, and place of residence to 5 randomly selected control subjects from the general population. Through register linkages, we collected information on breast cancer, breast cancer risk factors (age at childbirth, number of children, hormone replacement therapy), and socio‐economy. The relative risk of breast cancer after RA was assessed using Cox regression, and the relative risk of RA in women with a history of breast was assessed using conditional logistic regression. Results: The risk of incident breast cancer in women with RA was reduced and the association was not attenuated by adjustment for breast cancer risk factors (HR=0.80, 95%CI 0.68‐0.93)(Table 1). The risk was similar among seronegative RA, (HR=0.77, 95%CI 0.58‐1.02), and seropositive RA, (HR=0.81, 95%CI, 0.67‐0.98), and for all age groups. We noted reduced risks for all TNM stages, and for both pre‐and postmenopausal breast cancer (assessed with age cutoff 50 years). The risk of RA in women with a history of breast cancer was similarly reduced (OR=0.87, 95%CI, 0.79‐0.95). Odds ratios (OR) stratified by serostatus and age at RA diagnosis yielded similar results. There was no clear trend in the level of risk reduction when examining the risk by menopausal status, or cancer stage at breast cancer diagnosis. Women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen (OR=0.86, 95%CI 0.62‐1.20), or aromatase inhibitors (OR=0.97, 95%CI 0.69‐1.37), did not have an increased risk of RA compared to women with breast cancer treated differently. Conclusion: There is a decreased risk of breast cancer in patients with RA, and a similar decrease in risk of breast cancer before RA diagnosis. We did not find evidence to support that the decreased risk of breast cancer was due to known risk determinants. Furthermore, adjuvant anti‐hormonal therapy as used in secondary breast cancer pharmacoprevention did not seem to increase the risk of RA. (Table Presented).

AB  -  Purpose: This study compares immunohistochemical (IHC) versus molecular subtyping (BluePrint and MammaPrint) in the population of patients enrolled in MINDACT and outcome based on molecular subtyping (MS) versus surrogate pathological subtyping (PS) as defined by the 2013 St. Gallen guidelines. Methods: MS classified patients in the following subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER‐2‐, and Basal‐type. IHC/FISH for pathological subtyping (ER, PgR, HER‐2, and Ki67) was centrally assessed in the European Institute of Oncology (n = 5806). Hazard ratios for distant‐metastasis‐free survival (DMFS) by subtype were adjusted for chemotherapy and endocrine therapy administration and thus independent of adjuvant treatment allocation. Results: PS Luminal cancers classified as HER‐2+ or Basal‐type by MS did not have a significantly lower DMFS than the Luminal‐type cancers by MS (95.9%): HR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.75–2.60 (p = 0.294). More patients were identified with Luminal A disease by MS (63%) as compared with PS (47%) with comparable 5‐year DMFS (≥96.0%). Among the 500 patients with PS TN cancers, MS identified 24 (5%) patients as Luminal‐type with 5‐year DMFS estimated at 100% versus 71.4% for MS HER‐2+ or 90.1% for MS Basal‐type. Conclusions: MS was able to re‐stratify 54% of patients with a Luminal‐B PS subtype to a low‐risk Luminal A‐type group with comparable outcome. Among TN EBC, 5% were classified as Luminal by MS with Luminal‐like outcome. Molecular classification can help to identify a larger group of patients with low risk of recurrence compared with the more contemporarily used classification methodology including high‐quality assessed Ki67.

AB  -  Polymorphisms of genes involved in estrogen synthesis have been linked to breast cancer risk, prognosis, and treatment response. We investigated the prognostic impact of a deletion spanning the entire UGT2B17 gene (UGT2B17*2) and genetic variants of the aromatase CYP19A1 and estrogen receptor α (ESR1) in 125 postmenopausal women with ER‐positive breast cancer enrolled in a randomized pre‐surgical trial. The UGT2B17*2 was estimated by copy number variation assays and the CYP19A1 rs10046/rs4646 and ESR1 rs2077647/rs2234693/rs9340799 by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Serum exemestane/17‐hydroxy exemestane were determined by MS and estrone (E1)/estradiol (E2)/ by GC‐MS/MS. The association of genetic polymorphisms with “any event” was assessed by the Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for confounders. The UGT2B17*2 was associated with higher levels of 17‐hydroxy exemestane (P = 0.04) and better prognosis (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.20–1.01; P = 0.05) compared with homozygote UGT2B17 wt. The CYP19A1 rs10046 A and rs4646 C alleles were associated with higher estrogen levels: rs10046 AA vs. AG/GG genotypes had median E1 of 35.9 vs. 27.4 pg/mL (P = 0.05) and E2 of 7.57 vs. 3.9 pg/mL (P < 0.004). After a median follow‐up of 7 years, women carrying the “low estrogen” alleles rs10046 G and rs4646 A had a better prognosis compared with homozygote wt for both polymorphisms (HR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17–0.93; P = 0.03). Our analysis points to an impact of UGT2B17 and CYP19A1 in postmenopausal endocrine responsive breast cancer. Carriers of UGT2B17*2 and CYP19A1 low estrogen variants may have better prognosis, supporting studies addressing the role of these polymorphisms in optimizing endocrine therapy.

AB  -  The drug's activity at the target tissue could help to define the minimal effective dose to promote cancer preventive therapy. Here we present exemestane and sex hormone concentrations within breast tissue from a pre‐surgical study of alternative exemestane schedules. Postmenopausal women candidate for breast surgery for estrogen receptor‐positive breast cancer were randomized to exemestane 25 mg once daily (QD), 25 mg three times/week (TIW), or 25 mg per/week (QW) for 4‐6 weeks before surgery. Drug and sex hormones were analyzed from homogenized frozen tissue using a QTRAP 6500+ LC‐MS/MS System. Tissue drug concentrations were detectable only in the QD arm with higher concentrations in non‐malignant tissue. Estradiol was nearly suppressed in all groups in the non‐malignant tissue (QD vs TIW p = .364 and QD vs QW p = .693). In contrast, a dose‐response trend was observed in cancer tissue. Based on estradiol suppression in non‐malignant tissue, lower exemestane schedules should be explored for breast cancer preventive therapy.

AB  -  Consumption of dietary lignans has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We sought to determine if urinary excretion of ENL, the predominant microbial metabolite of dietary lignans, was associated with plasma protein abundance using a cross‐sectional design based on data and plasma collected from 80 healthy participants in a randomized crossover, controlled feeding study. Proteomic analysis was performed on plasma samples collected at the end of each of two diet periods (160 samples total) using a customized antibody array corresponding to 2072 unique proteins. GC‐MS was used to measure ENL excretion in 24‐h urine samples collected in tandem with plasma. Linear mixed models tested the association between urinary enterolignan excretion and plasma protein abundance. Subsequently, over‐representation analysis was conducted considering 17 a priori pathways with putative associations with enterolignan bioactivity in an exploratory approach. Controlling the false discovery rate at 10%, ENL excretion was inversely associated with seven proteins (FCRL5, PSCA, GAB1, LAPTM5, CCS, REG4, CEACAM1), and positively associated with two proteins (WAS and FBLN5). Over‐representation analysis revealed associations of ENL excretion with estrogen and TNF signaling pathways, which were not significant after adjustment for false discovery. These ENL‐associated proteins and pathways have potential implications in cancer prevention.

AB  -  Aminoglutethimide and testololactone may be considered the first generation aromatase inhibitors for the endocrine treatment of breast carcinoma. Initially, both of these agents were designed and used clinically based on different concepts of their mechanisms of action. Only later were they both demonstrated to inhibit aromatase. Curiously, testololactone was earlier and more widely used than aminoglutethimide in treating advanced breast carcinoma. The discovery of the peripheral aromatase inhibition as the proper mechanism of action was delayed for both the agents but was relatively more timely for aminoglutethimide. Paradoxically, the clinical use of testololactone has become already obsolete since its true mechanism of action was discovered. Aminoglutethimide is still the most widely used aromatase inhibitor in treating advanced breast carcinoma. Due to the initial misinterpretation of its mechanism of action, aminoglutethimide was used for a long time at a relative high daily dose, always combined with hydrocortisone. Subsequent phase II and then randomized phase III studies demonstrated an equivalent efficacy using half (500 mg) of the previous conventional daily dose (1000 mg), with hydrocortisone. Very recently, a randomized clinical trial demonstrated that administering this lower dose without hydrocortisone did not significantly decrease the clinical efficacy. By decreasing the dose of aminoglutethimide, the incidence of side effects has been reduced. So, the last paradoxical aspect of the aminoglutethimide story is that this agent seemed initially very toxic but finally, with the new schedules, shows a very low toxicity profile, especially after the first few weeks of treatment.

AB  -  Background: In DB‐06, pts with a history of HER2‐negative status by local test were screened; pts with HER2‐low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+, 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH]−) or HER2‐ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) mBC by central test were randomized to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T‐DXd) or treatment of physician’s choice (TPC). T‐DXd demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median progression‐free survival (PFS) vs TPC in pts with HR+, HER2‐low mBC who received ≥1L of endocrine therapy and no chemotherapy for mBC; outcomes were consistent for HER2‐ultralow. Clinical validation of local and central HER2 scoring was performed. Methods: HER2 scores were centrally determined using the VENTANA anti‐HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody (Roche) assay, and an on‐market HER2 ISH assay, as applicable, per manufacturer’s instructions. Samples from pts with metastatic disease were tested. Concordance between local and central HER2 scores was assessed by overall percent agreement (OPA), and subgroup analyses of PFS were performed by sample characteristics. Results: Valid central and local HER2 test results were available for 1629 pts; central tests found 12% IHC 0 (absent membrane staining), 21% HER2‐ultralow, and 67% HER2‐low. OPA was 77.8% for HER2‐low. Of 349 pts scored as HER2 IHC 0 locally, 85 (24%) were centrally determined as HER2‐low and 140 (40%) as HER2‐ultralow. A PFS benefit with T‐DXd was consistently observed across subgroups, including by HER2 IHC score, sample type, and tumor location. Conclusions: Pts with HR+ mBC determined as HER2‐low or HER2‐ultralow using the VENTANA HER2 (4B5) assay (and ISH when applicable) derived clinical benefit from T‐DXd, irrespective of sample type used to determine HER2 status. Of note, 64% of pts with a local HER2 IHC 0 score were classed as HER2‐low or HER2‐ultralow by central test. It may be advisable for pts with HR+ HER2 IHC 0 mBC to be reassessed to determine T‐DXd eligibility. As the HER2‐ultralow cutoff is not part of standard clinical practice, increased awareness of low HER2 expression levels is desirable. Clinical trial identification: NCT04494425.

AB  -  Purpose Bone loss in association with the menopausal transition begins approximately 2 years before the last menstrual period. This study evaluated the efficacy of ALN in comparison to placebo in preventing bone loss in perimenopausal women with low BMD. Methods Inclusion Criteria: Women, aged 4055, experiencing at least five menstrual cycles per year, confirmed FSH level of > 20 iu/L and lower than 40 iu/L on two separate occasions; reduced bone density T < ‐1.0 of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck. Exclusion Criteria: No patient was enrolled if any of the following criteria were met: patients with hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, liver disease, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloma, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, or polycystic ovarian disease; patients treated with any of the following medications less than six months prior to enrolment: androgens, calcitonin, systemic corticosteroids, fluoride, PTH, SERMS, estrogen, oral contraceptives, bisphosphonates, vitamin D > 2000 IU daily, or vitamin D metabolites; patients not clinically euthyroid or who have had a dosage change of > 25 ug of levothyroxine within the previous year; patients with impaired renal function (serum creatinine > 177 umol/L); patients consuming excess alcohol defined as more than four of the following per day: 30 mL of distilled spirits, 340 mL of beer or 120 mL of wine, and subjects with a history of allergy or intolerance to bisphosphonates. Patients with esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia were excluded. Patients with hypocalcemia (corrected calcium < 2.2 mmol/L), patients unable to stand or sit upright for 30 minutes and patients who had a positive beta HCG test on screening were also excluded. Patients meeting study criteria were randomized to either therapy or control groups Therapy consisted of 70mg of Alendronate and 2800 IU cholecalciferol once per week for one year; Control subjects received a placebo tablet. All patients also received 500 mg of supplemental calcium carbonate daily. Biochemistry tests at baseline and 12 months included: bone specific ALP, creatinine, random urine creatinine, and Ntelopeptide (NTX) in serum and urine. BMD was measured by Dualenergy X‐ray absorptiometry at LS,FN, and TH sites. Differences at 12 months in BMD and biochemical markers were compared. Given random assignment, analysis of covariance was performed with the BMD at 12 months as our dependent, the baseline BMD as the covariate, and group (ALN versus placebo) as a fixed factor. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that in perimenopausal women treatment with alendronate over 12 months is effective in lowering bone turnover and improving BMD at the LS. Early intervention with a bisphosphonate for 12 months in the menopausal transition may be effective in maintaining BMD and microarchitectural integrity.

AB  -  Introduction ‐ Women develop abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) five to ten years later than men (1,2). The delay in AAA development may be secondary to a protection from estrogens (3,4). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of risk factors associated with AAA development in women, including postmenopausal hormone therapy. This has previously been investigated in small cohorts with limited information. Methods ‐ In a total cohort of 106,000 individuals from the Norwegian Nord‐Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), 20,024 postmenopausal women were identified, of which 201 developed AAAs during a median follow‐up of 18 years (1995‐2014, i.e. 295,554 person‐years). The data is based on questionnaires, physical measurements, medical records and blood samples. A multivariable Cox regression model was constructed, where the final adjusted model included the following variables: smoking (current, past, never), body mass index, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal hormone therapy. Multiple imputation was performed for missing data (n=50 data sets). Serum estradiol concentrations were compared between women who later did or did not develop AAAs. Median time from blood sample collection to AAA diagnosis was seven years. Results ‐ Mean age at AAA diagnosis was 77 (59 ‐100) years. 28% of the cohort reported ever use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. In the multivariable analysis, a notable Hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 was observed for current use of hormone therapy, but the result was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.29‐1.16, p=0.12). Women who reported current smoking had a more than ten‐fold risk for developing AAA during follow‐up (HR 10.9 (7.4‐16.1)). Positive associations were also found for hypertension (HR 2.0 (1.4‐3.0)) and coronary heart disease (HR 2.2 (1.6‐3.2)). There was no substantial difference in estradiol concentrations between women with and without AAA (p=0.06). Conclusion ‐ Postmenopausal hormone therapy is of less clinical importance compared to the strong associations observed between smoking, hypertension coronary heart disease and AAA development in women. These findings were supported by measured estradiol concentrations. References 1. Lo RC, Bensley RP, Hamdan AD, Wyers M, Adams JE, Schermerhorn ML.

AB  -  Many natural substances were screened to develop nutraceuticals that reduce menopausal symptoms. A complex of Cirsium japonicum var. maackii and Thymus vulgaris extracts, named MS‐10, had significant positive effects. Under a low concentration of estrogen, which represents postmenopausal physiological conditions, MS‐10 had beneficial effects on estrogen receptor‐expressing MCF‐7 cells by reversibly enhancing estrogen activity. In addition, in the ovariectomized rat model, changes in bone‐specific alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin, as well as low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly decreased by MS‐10. These results show that MS‐10 protected bone health and reduced metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, in a clinical study, all menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, parenthesis, insomnia, nervousness, melancholia, vertigo, fatigue, rheumatic pain, palpitations, formication, and headache, as well as colpoxerosis, were significantly improved by taking MS‐10 for 90 days. Therefore, the evidence supports that MS‐10 is an effective natural substance that can safely improve menopausal symptoms, including colpoxerosis.

AB  -  HYPOTHESIS / AIMS OF STUDY: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which affects up to 50% of postmenopausal women, is defined as a collection of genital and urinary symptoms and signs associated with a decrease in estrogen and other sex steroids. It leads to changes to the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra and bladder. Current treatments, i.e. local hormonal therapy (HT) or systemic HT and vaginal moisturizer, may not be suitable for some women and may cause adverse effects or allergies. Also, some women prefer not to use HT In a US survey of women with GSM, 59% of women receiving treatment reported still feeling symptoms and to be “not satisfied” with their present treatment efficacy [1]. Therefore, there is a real need to investigate safe and effective complementary GSM treatments. In a recent case study, a pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training program appeared to reduce GSM symptoms and signs [2]. It can be hypothesized that these results are related to improvement in vulvovaginal blood flow, tissue elasticity, pH and/or PFM tone [2]. However, no cohort study has yet investigated the effect of PFM training on GSM. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a PFM training program on the most bothersome symptom (MBS) of GSM, in postmenopausal women. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of a PFM training program on GSM signs, activities of daily living, quality of life and sexual function. STUDY DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with GSM, aged 55 or over, were recruited for this cohort study from a mother‐study on urinary incontinence. The diagnosis of GSM was confirmed by a gynecologist based on a standardized assessment. Subjects with vulvar dermatological diseases, gynecological radiation, vaginal or urinary tract infections within the previous three months, and those taking antiestrogenic medication, were excluded. Dosage of HT medication and use of a vaginal moisturizer had to be stable for at least six months before the study to ensure symptom stability. Each woman participated in two pre‐intervention evaluations (PREI and PRE2), a 12‐week PFM training program and a post‐intervention evaluation (POST). PREI included questionnaires on severity of GSM symptoms (MBS questionnaire) and their impact on activities of daily living (Atrophy symptoms questionnaire) as well as condition‐specific questionnaires on quality of life and sexual function (ICIQ‐VS and ICIQ‐FLUTSsex). GSM signs were assessed with the Vaginal Health Assessment scale. PRE2 was conducted two weeks later to document the stability of GSM symptom and sign measurements. POST was the same assessment as PREI. After ensuring correct PFM contraction, the 12‐week PFM training program included a weekly one‐hour PFM training program with a physiotherapist and daily home‐based progressive PFM exercises. One‐way repeated ANOVA were used to investigate the differences in outcome measures assessed at PREI, PRE2 and POST. A paired‐samples t‐test was used to detect statistical differences in outcomes evaluated at PREI and POST. RESULTS: Thirty‐one women with a mean age of 68.0 ± 6.6 years and mean parity of 1.8 ± 1.1 were recruited. Twenty participants were sexually active (having intercourse). Twelve participants had treatment for GSM symptoms (local HT: 8; systemic HT: 2; vaginal moisturizer: 2) whose dosage and use remained stable during their study participation. Three women dropped out of the study for personal reasons (time constraint). Overall, as shown in Table 1, the severity of the GSM symptoms on the MBS questionnaire decreased significantly after the PFM training program (p<0.01) with improvement in the severity of the MBS in 22/29 of women (76%) and no change in 7/29 of them (24%). None of the participants had an increase in MBS severity after the intervention. GSM signs improved on the Vaginal Health Assessment scale, particularly vaginal secretions, vaginal epithelial thickness and vaginal color (p<0.01). The impact of GSM symptoms on activities of daily living as measured by the Atrophy Symptom questionnaire was reduced significantly (p<0.01). There was a reduction of the impact of GSM on quality of life (ICIQ‐VS QoL sub‐scale; p<0.01) and on sexual function (ICIQ‐VS sexual matters subscale; p<0.01; ICIQ‐FLUTSsex; p=0.01). INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: PFM training has been shown to improve symptoms of urinary incontinence and prolapse in the past. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of a PFM training program on the symptoms and signs of GSM. After a 12‐week PFM training program, improvements in the severity of the MBS of GSM were found. On physical assessment, vaginal secretions, vaginal epithelial thickness and vaginal color were improved after the intervention. A reduction in GSM's impact on activities of daily living, quality of life and sexual function was also shown. Similar results were obtained after a PFM training program in women with gynecological cancer, for whom radical hysterectomy and radiotherapy cause symptoms that relate to those of GSM [3]. With the high proportion of women treated for GSM still reporting symptoms and being “not satisfied” with current treatment efficacy [1], PFM training could become a treatment of interest alone or as a complimentary therapy for women with GSM. Moreover, as it is safe and without side effects, it could be used in women for whom local HT is con‐traindicated or in those having adverse effects with their GSM treatment (vaginal irritation, vaginal bleeding, breast pain, allergy). CONCLUDING MESSAGE: Our research findings are original as they suggest that a PFM training program improves both GSM symptoms and signs, as well as reducing the impact of GSM on activities of daily living, quality of life and sexual function. A randomized controlled trial is now needed to confirm these results.

AB  -  Therapeutic use of glucocorticoids can lead to many well‐known adverse events. Of all potential serious side effects, glucocorticoid‐induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is one of the most devastating complications of protracted glucocorticoid therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. GIOP is the most common form of drug‐induced osteoporosis. Although much has been written about the association of glucocorticoids with bone disease among patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, many issues remain unsettled. This article focuses on areas of continued controversies, including the epidemiology and pathogenesis of GIOP, specification of a "safe" dose, methods for diagnosis of GIOP, and an evidence‐based approach for GIOP prevention.

AB  -  Background: Treatment of bone‐metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is limited. Multimodality therapy may improve symptom control and survival. In a phase 2a study of advanced breast cancer pts with bone‐dominant and no visceral disease, Ra‐223, a firstinclass αemitter selectively targeting bone mets, reduced baseline bone biomarker levels with favorable safety (Coleman et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat 2014). This study (NCT02258464 ) evaluates Ra‐223 efficacy and safety vs placebo (pbo) in HER2‐hormone receptor+ breast cancer pts with bone mets receiving single‐agent HT. Methods: Pts receive (1:1) Ra‐223 50 kBq/kg IV or pbo q 4 wk (6 cycles) + concurrent single‐agent HT + best supportive care. Stratification is by geographic region, prior lines of HT for MBC, and number of prior skeletal events. Pts are assessed for efficacy and safety, and followed to symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), radiologic progression, death, or withdrawal. Primary endpoint is SSE‐free survival. Eligible pts are preor postmenopausal with estrogen receptor+, HER2‐, bone‐dominant MBC with ≥2 bone mets and ≥1 or 2 prior SSEs (external beam radiotherapy for bone pain, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, orthopedic surgery). Pts had ≥1 line of HT for MBC; are taking bisphosphonates or denosumab for ≥1 month before study; are eligible for endocrine treatment; and have evaluable disease (RECIST 1.1), asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic bone disease (Brief Pain Inventory), ECOG score 0‐1, and adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function. Pts may not have had visceral or brain mets or leptomeningeal disease, need for chemotherapy for mets, and untreated spinal cord compression. Assuming a 1‐sided α of 0.1, power of 90%, ∼ 119 SSEs are required for the analysis. Time‐to‐event variable analysis will use a log‐rank test, accounting for stratification. Kaplan‐Meier estimates and survival curves will be given for each treatment group. Safety analyses will be descriptive. Target enrollment is 227 pts. First pt first visit is expected in early 2015.

AB  -  Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) may be associated with breast cancer susceptibility and endocrine‐mediated side effects. The IBCSG Tamoxifen (Tam) and Exemestane (Exe) Trial (TEXT) includes a translational research project to assess whether selected SNPs may influence treatment efficacy and toxicity. We report on early‐onset hot flashes and sweating (HF/S) and musculoskeletal symptoms (MS; myalgia, arthralgia, stiffness) with respect to CYP19A1 and ESR1 SNPs under combined endocrine therapy. Patients and Methods: 2,672 premenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer were randomized to treatment with the GnRH‐agonist triptorelin (Trip)+Tam or Trip+Exe for 5 years. Randomization was stratified according to intended use of chemotherapy (yes/no) and lymph node status (N‐ vs N+). Estrogen‐depletion side effects (HF/S and MS) were recorded at baseline, 3‐monthly during the first year and 6‐monthly thereafter using the NCI CTCAE v3.0. DNA was centrally extracted from whole blood with Qiagen kits. SNPs of CYP19A1 (rs4646 and rs10046) and ESR1 (rs207764, rs2234693 and rs9340799) were analyzed by a pyrosequencing method (Diatech Pharmacogenetics S.r.l., Jesi, Italy). Control genotypes (wt/wt; wt/v; v/v) for all SNPs were processed in each run. Logistic regression was used to analyze two endpoints: presence or absence of grade (gr) 2‐3 HF/S during first 6 months and gr 2‐4 MS during first 12 months. Four genetic models were used to explore associations with side effects: genetic (wt/wt; wt/v; v/v), additive, dominant and recessive. Results: DNA was isolated and genotyped for 1970 (74%) consenting women. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of this cohort were consistent with the overall trial. At baseline median age was 44, median BMI 24 kg/m2 and 86% had regular menses. During follow‐up, 43% reported gr 2‐3 HF/S and 27% reported gr 2‐4 MS. The 5 SNPs did not deviate from Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.30) and minor allele frequency ranged from 29%‐48%. The CYP19A1 SNP rs10046 (C>T) was associated with gr 2‐3 HF/S. Specifically, women with variant homozygote genotype (T/T) had a reduced risk of HF/S (39% T/T vs 45%). The univariate odds ratio (OR) was 0.77 (95%CI: 0.62‐0.96; p=0.02) compared with other variant groups. The multivariate model showed consistent results after adjusting for age, BMI, menstrual status, chemo use, treatment allocation (Tam vs Exe) and baseline HF/S. The other 4 SNPs were not associated with the selected side effects. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates association of HF/S with CYP19A1 rs10046 genetic variants. The lack of association between early‐onset of selected estrogen‐depletion side effects and the other 4 SNPs may be masked by the concurrent Trip. Ovarian reserve before treatment may also influence the impact of SNP genotypes on early‐onset side effects. Further analysis with details of concurrent medications and treatment adherence will contribute to the interpretation of these results.

AB  -  The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of concurrent treatment with vitamin K2 and risedronate compared with treatment with risedronate alone in patients with osteoporosis and to explore subsets of patients for which concurrent treatment is particularly efficacious. Women with osteoporosis aged 65 years or older were recruited from 123 institutes in Japan and allocated to take either vitamin K2 (45 mg/day) and risedronate (2.5 mg/day or 17.5 mg/week) or risedronate (2.5 mg/day or 17.5 mg/week) alone. The primary end point was the incidence of any fracture (vertebral and nonvertebral). The secondary end points were bone mineral density, height, undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentration, quality of life, and safety. Over a 2‐year follow‐up, vertebral or nonvertebral fractures occurred in 117 or 22 sites respectively among 931 patients in the risedronate and vitamin K2 group and in 104 or 26 sites respectively among 943 patients in the risedronate alone group. The rates of any incident fracture were similar between the two groups (incidence rate ratio 1.074, 95 % confidence interval 0.811–1.422, p = 0.62), implying that the primary end point was not met. There were no differences in the degree of increase in bone mineral density between the two groups. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentration decreased from 5.81 ± 3.93 ng/mL to 2.59 ± 1.52 ng/mL at 6 months in the risedronate and vitamin K2 group, whereas the change in the risedronate alone group was minimal (from 5.96 ± 4.36 ng/mL to 4.05 ± 3.40 ng/mL at 6 months) (p < 0.01). The treatment discontinuation rate was higher in the risedronate and vitamin K2 group than in the risedronate alone group (10.0 % vs 6.7 %). No unknown adverse drug reactions were reported. In conclusion, concurrent treatment with vitamin K2 and risedronate was not efficacious compared with monotherapy with risedronate in terms of fracture prevention.

AB  -  Introduction: Obesity is associated with poor breast cancer outcomes in postmenopausal women. Our prior retrospective studies have shown that use of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with reduced recurrence in obese breast cancer patients and a doubling of time to recurrence. Because it was recently determined that CD163+ M2 macrophages were clinically associated with fast proliferation, poor differentiation, estrogen receptor negativity and histological duct type in human primary breast tumors, the mechanism proposed was a decrease in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and aromatase locally in the breast with a concomitant decrease in circulating M2‐activated tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Methods: Postmenopausal women of varying body habitus were recruited at the CTRC in San Antonio and underwent randomized assignment to 1 of 3 arms: Aspirin (ASA) at 81mg daily, 1500mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 2500mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) given daily, or combined ASA and DHA/EPA. Sera were collected prior to and following 28 days of exposure, and cytokines including prostaglandin E2 were assessed via enzyme Jinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 28 circulating cytokines/chemokines were assessed by Luminex array using Millipore Milliplex MAP to look for associations between cytokine array profiles, PGE2 production and macrophage activation. Circulating class M‐1 activated and M‐2 activated macrophages were enumerated by flow cytometry to assess how PGE2 modulation influences macrophage phenotype and function. Investigators were blinded to randomization until analysis was complete. Results: A total of 122 patients were randomized with 2 drop outs and 115 completing the 28 days of intervention as planned. The median BMI was 31.4, with 12.8% normal (BMI <25.0), 27.3% overweight (25.0‐ 29.9), and 59.9% obese (>29.9). Patients had a median age of 63 (47‐76), 91 % white, and 46.0 % Hispanic. A positive correlation was observed between BMI and baseline PGE2 levels. The most consistent impact on PGE2 was observed with ASA with 81% obtaining a decrease from baseline (median change ‐28%); by comparison 55.1 % (‐1 %) and 65.6% (‐22%) of subjects showed decrease in the DHA/EPA and combined groups respectively. As of today, full cytokine profiling was performed on a subset of 38 patients and revealed a positive correlation with change in PGE2 and cytokines: EGF, Eotaxin, GM‐CSF, IL1 Ra, IL5, IL8, MIP1b, and TNFa. Conclusion: Aspirin alone most consistently impacted patient circulating PGE2 levels, and will be used in planned studies as an adjunct to adjuvant endocrine therapy in obese hormone receptor positive post‐menopausal patients. Full cytokine and macrophage activation status will be reported.

AB  -  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Bothersome postmenopausal vaginal symptoms are prevalent and adversely affect quality of life and sexual activity. Although up to 40% of postmenopausal women have vaginal symptoms presumed to be related to low estrogen, limited evidence‐based information regarding the pathophysiology of symptoms exists. The MsFLASH Vaginal Health trial demonstrated no significant difference in improvement m vaginal symptoms between women randomized to 1) estradiol vaginal tablet (Vagifem®) + placebo gel or 2) hydrophilic moisturizing vaginal gel (Replens®) + placebo tablet versus placebo gel + placebo tablet. To better understand the primary results, we evaluated the impact of treatment on changes in the vaginal mucosal ecosystem. STUDY DESIGN: Double blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial with outcomes measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. SITES: Seattle, WA; Minneapolis, MN. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50‐70 with ≥ 1 moderate to severe symptom of vulvovaginal itching, pain, irritation, dryness or pain with penetration; ≥ 2 years postmenopausal; no acute vaginitis or history of chronic vaginitis; no use of hormone therapy in the past 2 months; and no use of vaginal moisturizer or antibiotics in the past month. METHODS: Analyses included women enrolled m the trial who provided vaginal swabs and cervicovaginal lavage at all 3 time points. The vaginal microbiota was characterized by sequencing of the V3V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Mass‐spectrometry‐based untargeted metabolomics was used to detect 171 small molecule metabolites in vaginal fluid. Gram stained slides were scored according to Nugent criteria. 1) A subset of 75 women (25 in each arm) was randomly selected to examine kinetics of the vaginal ecosystem changes with the different treatments. 2) A subgroup analysis compared 60 randomly selected women with ≥ 2‐point decrease in most bothersome symptom (MBS) severity over 12 weeks to 60 randomly selected women with a ≤ 1‐point decrease in MBS severity‐over 12 weeks. The 2 groups were matched by treatment arm, age, race, study site, self‐reported MBS. 3) Among women with baseline microbiota data available we assessed correlations between Nugent score, Amsel criteria (pH, clue cells, vaginal discharge, amine odor) and the diversity and composition of the vaginal microbiota. RESULTS: We will present the following: 1) We compared the kinetics of the vaginal microbiota and the vaginal fluid metabolome between treatment arms to assess estrogenic effects over study time. We examined relationships between 12‐week changes in individual bacterial taxa and metabolites by treatment arm. 2) We compared bacterial diversity and the composition of the vaginal fluid metabolome between women whose symptoms did or did not improve, to better define whether there is a biological phenotype associated with the presence or absence of postmenopausal vaginal discomfort. 3) Among the 144 women with vaginal microbiota data at baseline, we compared the diversity of the vaginal microbiota between women whose Nugent scores were negative (0‐3), intermediate (4‐6), or BV positive (7‐10) and assess associations of individual taxa and individual Amsel criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our results assess how the vaginal environment changes with treatments for postmenopausal vaginal discomfort, and whether changes m the vaginal ecosystem are a marker or cause of bothersome vaginal symptoms. Findings provide new insight into the pathophysiology of postmenopausal vaginal symptoms. Criteria for diagnosing postmenopausal BV is problematic as one of the 4 Amsel criteria, pH, is almost always elevated; new standards for an optimal vaginal ecosystem m postmenopausal women are needed.

AB  -  Background: Treatment options for bone‐dominant metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are limited. Radium‐223 (Ra‐223), a first‐in‐class a emitter with a targeted antitumor effect on bone metastases (mets), was well tolerated and reduced bone biomarker levels in a phase 2 study in patients with bone‐dominant MBC (Coleman et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat 2014). In patients with HER2‐ estrogen receptor∗ (ER+) bone‐dominant MBC, everolimus + exemestane (EVE+EXE) improved progression‐free survival (PFS) vs EXE alone. Ra‐223 plus EVE+EXE may improve outcomes in patients with HER2‐ ER+ bone‐dominant MBC; this trial will evaluate efficacy and safety of Ra‐223 vs placebo in these patients (NCT02258451 ). Methods: Eligible patients are pre‐ or postmenopausal with HER2‐ ER+ MBC and ≥ 2 bone or soft tissue mets. Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, ≥ 1 prior line of hormone therapy for MBC, and 1‐2 prior skeletal‐related events; be on bisphosphonates or denosumab; and have an ECOG score of 0‐1. Patients must have had no past or current need for chemotherapy for MBC, no unresolved spinal cord compression, and no prior EVE treatment. Patients are randomized to receive (1:1) Ra‐223 (50 kBq/kg IV) or placebo x 6 cycles q 4 wk plus EXE (25 mg PO q d) + EVE (10 mg PO q d) plus best supportive care. EXE+EVE continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification is by geographic region (EU/N Amer v Asia), prior hormone therapy (1 v ≥ 2), and presence of visceral disease (yes v no). Safety and efficacy are assessed every 4 weeks. Long‐term safety is assessed until study termination.The primary end point is symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)‐free survival. Secondary end points are overall survival; times to opiate use, pain progression, and chemotherapy; radiologic PFS; and safety. Assuming a 1‐sided a of 0.1, 90% power, ∼ 160 SSEs will be required for the analysis. Efficacy will be analyzed by a stratified log‐rank test. Safety analysis will be descriptive. Estimated enrollment is ∼ 311 patients. Currently, 29 patients are randomized.

AB  -  Background Hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC) is the most common subtype of BC (70‐80%). This subset tends to have good prognosis, therefore most patients with localized disease have excellent long‐term survival, approaching 100% 5‐year relative survival. However, 10% of patients experience loco‐regional recurrence (LRR) within 5 year of final surgical management of the primary disease‐well within the typical treatment window of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Few studies exists to guide the systemic treatment of patients who have suffered LRR of HR+ HER2 ‐BC. The randomized controlled CALOR trial demonstrated no benefit to systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy for this subgroup of patients and persistent high rate of subsequent recurrences (50% within 10 years on LRR event). There is no standard of care for managing this patient population. The combination of ribociclib and endocrine therapy (ET) (fulvestrant and aromatase inhibitors) is FDA approved for management of unresectable recurrences and metastatic HR+HER‐BC (MONALEESA trials). CDK4/6 inhibitors have been investigated in early BC setting too, several trials showing positive results (monarchE, NATALEE). Data is needed to investigate their use in patients with LRR. Trial design This is a multicenter, single arm phase II study to evaluate efficacy and safety of ribociclib and ET in patients with LRR of HR+HER2‐BC. Treatment includes ribociclib for 36 months, 600 mg daily for 21 days, 28‐day cycle plus physician's choice ET for 60 months (fulvestrant or AIs). Ribociclib dose was chosen based on approved dose in metastatic BC. Eligibility Criteria Patients ≥ 18 of age, with LRR of BC (ipsilateral breast, axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall), histologically confirmed estrogen receptor positive and/or progesterone receptor positive, HER 2 negative. Patients must have adequate local treatment for LRR (surgery and/or radiation) with negative microscopic margins, no evidence of distant metastatic disease. Prior treatment with neo‐adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and ET is allowed, no prior CDK 4/6 inhibitor in the last 12 months. Pre and post‐menopausal women are allowed. Patient must enroll within 6 months of the last local therapy. Specific aims Primary objective: to estimate subsequent recurrence‐free survival (RFS) at 3 years for ribociclib when administered with ET in patients with HR + HER2‐BC with adequately resected local recurrence. Secondary objectives: to estimate distant metastasis‐free survival and overall survival, to evaluate safety and tolerability, to identify predictors of LRR. Correlative analysis will explore prognostic and predictive biomarkers of treatment with ribociclib and ET and potential molecular mechanisms of resistance to treatment. Statistical Methods From previous published data (J Clin Oncol. 2018 Apr 10;36(11):1073‐1079), we assume that patients receiving standard of‐care management following recurrence would have a recurrence free survival (RFS) rate of 80% at 3 years and that treatment with ribociclib + ET will increase it by 7%. We wish to have at least 80% power at that significance level of 0.0487 to correctly detect that improvement in RFS rate at 3 years from 80 to 87%. Because only an improvement in RFS rate is of clinical interest, we have a directional hypothesis, and have used a 1‐sided alpha. Using a one‐sample survival study design, with assumed accrual duration of 3‐years and additional follow‐up time of 3 years, the minimum sample size requirement is N=180 patients. Target accrual The minimum sample size requirement is N=180 patients. A bigger sample size of N=200 patients will achieve a power of at least 84%. Current accrual is 6/200.

AB  -  Objective: Postmenopausal (PM) women can experience bothersome symptoms including hot flashes/night sweats. Estrogen plus progestogen therapies (EPT) represent the current standard of care but can cause side effects including breast pain/tenderness and vaginal spotting/bleeding. The objective of this study was to assess the humanistic burden of menopausal symptoms and EPT side effects in a large sample of PM women in the US. Design: This was a multi‐center observational study with 352 PM women. The sample included: PMwomen taking EPT with side effects (side effects sample; n=202); PM women taking EPT without side effects (control sample; n=75); PM women not taking EPT with menopausal symptoms (untreated sample; n=75). The following Patient‐Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments were completed by all women at baseline: Breast Sensations Impact Questionnaire (BSIQ), Post‐Menopausal Bleeding Impact Questionnaire (PMBIQ), Menopause‐ Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MENQOL) Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and EuroQoL Five Dimension Five Level questionnaire (EQ‐5D‐ 5L). The Menopause Symptoms Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSTSQ) was completed by side effects and control samples only. Two electronic daily diaries (eDiaries), the Breast Pain and Tenderness Daily Diary (BPT‐DD) and Vaginal Bleeding and Spotting Daily Diary (VBS‐DD), were completed by the side effects sample daily for 28 days post baseline. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD) and repeated‐measures models were used to examine differences between various groups of participants. Results: Health status, as assessed by the EQ‐5D‐5L (possible score range: ‐0.109 to 1.000), was highest for the control sample who had no EPT side effects (0.93), followed by the side effects sample (0.85) and lowest for the untreated sample (0.84), with significant differences among the groups (p>0.001). In the side effects sample, average frequency of vaginal spotting/ bleeding, as measured by the VBS‐DD (possible score range: 0‐100%), was less than 30% across each seven‐day period; women aged 40‐50 years reported more frequent vaginal spotting/bleeding than older age groups with significant differences between the groups (mean percentage range: 19.7‐ 28.8% vs. 13.8‐17.6% [51‐60 years] and 4.4‐15.2% [≥61 years]; p>0.05). The side effects sample reported greater impacts from vaginal spotting/ bleeding on each domain of the PMBIQ compared to the control sample (p>0.001). Women aged ≥61 years reported lower impacts from vaginal spotting/ bleeding than younger participants, with significant differences between the age groups (1.2 [≥61 years] vs. 1.4 [40‐50 years] and 1.4 [51‐60 years]; with a possible score range of 1‐5; p>0.05). Mean scores of breast sensation severity, as measured by the BPT‐DD (possible score range 0‐10), ranged from 1.3‐1.5 across each seven‐day period with no significant differences between age groups. Impacts from breast sensations, as measured by BSIQ, were comparable among all groups, with no significant differences between samples or age groups. Severity of menopausal symptoms, as measured by the MRS, was significantly higher in the untreated sample compared to the side effects and control samples (p>0.001). Menopausal symptoms, as measured by the MENQOL, were higher in the untreated sample compared to the side effects and control samples, with statistically significant differences among the groups (p>0.001). The control sample reported significantly greater treatment satisfaction on each domain and total score of the MS‐TSQ compared to the side effects sample (p>0.001). Participants aged ≥61 years reported greater satisfaction on the MS‐TSQ 'administration' and 'tolerability' domains compared to younger participants, with significant differences among the three groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: Both menopausal symptoms and EPT side effects can be burdensome for women, impacting multiple domains of HRQoL. Findings highlight the need for effective hormone therapy without burdensome side effects.

AB  -  Background: Bone‐metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment (tx) is limited. In a phase 2a study of bone‐dominant MBC patients (pts), Ra‐223, a first‐in‐class a emitter with targeted cytotoxic effect on bone metastases (mets), reduced bone biomarker levels with favorable safety (Coleman et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat 2014). This study evaluates efficacy and safety of Ra‐223 v placebo (pbo), each + endocrine treatment (ET) in pts with HER2‐ estrogen receptor (ER)+ bone‐dominant MBC (NCT02258464 ). Methods: Eligible pts are pre‐ or postmenopausal with HER2‐ ER+ bone‐dominant MBC with > 2 bone mets, soft tissue mets, and 1‐2 prior symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) (external beam radiotherapy, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, orthopedic surgery) who have received ≥ 1 line ET for MBC and are considered appropriate for further ET. Eligible pts must have evaluable disease (RECIST 1.1), be taking bisphosphonates or denosumab for > 1 mo before study tx, have an ECOG score 0‐1, and have adequate heme, renal, and liver function. Pts must not have had visceral or brain mets or leptomeningeal disease, or need chemotherapy for MBC and must not be suitable for everolimus for MBC. Pts are not eligible if they have prior Ra‐223 tx or untreated spinal cord compression. Pts receive (1:1) Ra‐223 50 kBq/kg IV or pbo q 4 wk (6 cycles) + ET + denosumab or bisphosphonates + best supportive care. Stratification is by geographic region, number of prior ET lines (1 v ≥ 2) for MBC, and number of prior skeletal events (1 v 2). Pts are assessed for efficacy and safety, and followed to SSE, radiologic progression, death, or withdrawal. The primary end point is SSE‐free survival. Secondary end points are radiologic progression‐free survival; overall survival; times to opioid use, pain progression, and chemotherapy; pain improvement rate; and safety. Assuming 1‐sided a 0.1, power 90%, ∼ 119 SSEs are needed for analysis. Time‐to‐event analysis will use a log‐rank test, accounting for stratification. Kaplan‐Meier estimates and survival curves will be given for each tx group. Safety analyses will be descriptive. Currently, 25 pts are randomized.

Patients are randomized to receive (1:1) Ra‐223 (50 kBq/kg [55 kBq/kg after National Institute of Standards and Technology update] IV) or placebo × 6 cycles q 4 wk plus EXE (25 mg PO q d) + EVE (10 mg PO q d) plus best supportive care. EXE + EVE continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification is by geographic region (EU/N Amer vs Asia), prior hormone therapy (1 vs ≥ 2), and presence of visceral disease (yes vs no). Safety and efficacy are assessed every 4 weeks. Long‐term safety is assessed until study termination. The primary end point is symptomatic skeletal event‐free survival (SSE‐FS).

AB  -  Osteoporosis is a disease characterised by low bone mass, structural deterioration of bone and increased risk of fracture. The prevalence, and cost, of osteoporosis is increasing dramatically with our ageing population and the World Health Organization now considers it to be the second‐leading healthcare problem. All currently approved therapies for osteoporosis (eg., estrogen, bisphosphonates, calcitonin and selective estrogen receptor modulators) are anti‐resorptive agents that act on osteoclasts to prevent further bone loss. A new class of bone anabolic agent capable of building mechanically strong new bone in patients with established osteoporosis is in development. While the parathyroid hormone (PTH) is classically considered to be a bone catabolic agent, when delivered intermittently at low doses PTH potently stimulates cortical and trabecular bone growth in animals humans. The native hPTH‐(1‐84) and its osteogenic fragment, hPTH‐(1‐34), have already entered Phase III clinical trials. Understanding the mechanism of PTH's osteogenic actions has led to the development of smaller PTH analogues which can also build mechanically normal bone in osteopenic rats. These new PTH analogues are promising candidates for treating osteoporosis in humans as they are as efficacious as hPTH‐(1‐84) and hPTH‐(1‐34), but there is evidence that they may have considerably less ability to induce hypercalcemia, the major side effect of PTH therapy. In addition to treating osteoporosis, PTHs may be used to promote fracture healing, to restore bone loss in immobilized patients, or following excessive glucocorticoid or prolonged spaceflight, and to treat psoriasis.

AB  -  Background: Korean red ginseng (KRG) is a processed ginseng from raw ginseng to enhance safety, preservation and efficacy, known having beneficial effects on women's health due to its estrogen like function. While estrogen supplementation showed some modulation of endocrine disrupting chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA) has been focused as a potential endocrine disrupting chemical. In this study, we examined the efficacy and safety outcomes of KRG against BPA, focusing on female quality of life (QOL). Individual variations in susceptibility to KRG were also investigated with the Sasang Typology, the personalized medicine used for hundred years in Korea.Methods: We performed a single‐blind randomized clinical trial. Study subjects were young women (N = 22), consumed 2.7 g of KRG or placebo per day for 2 weeks and filled up questionnaires regarding gynecologic complaints at the 4 time spots. We analyzed urinary total BPA and malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress biomarker, with GC/MS and HPLC/UVD respectively, and diagnosed their Sasang Typology with the questionnaire for the Sasang constitution Classification (QSCC II).Results: KRG consumption decreased urinary BPA and MDA levels (ps < 0.05) and alleviated 'menstrual irregularity', 'menstrual pain', and 'constipation' (ps < 0.05). SoEum type (Lesser Yin person) among the Sasang types showed significant alleviation in insomnia, flushing, perspiration and appetite by KRG consumption, rather than other Sasang types. During the intervention, no one experienced any aggravated side effects.Conclusion: We suggest KRG is efficient for protection for female QOL and BPA‐ exposure and ‐ related oxidative stress. However, individual variation in susceptibility to KRG should be further considered for identifying ideal therapy.

AB  -  The oxysterol 27‐hydroxycholesterol (27‐OHC) is an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator implicated in breast cancer etiology. It is unknown whether circulating 27‐OHC is associated with colorectal neoplasia risk. Circulating 27‐OHC was measured using LC/MS in fasting plasma collected at baseline from participants of the Vitamin D/Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a completed randomized clinical trial. Participants were between 45 and 75 years old, recently diagnosed with ?1 colorectal adenoma, and followed for new colorectal polyps during colonoscopic surveillance. Adjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of new colorectal polyps were estimated for quartiles of circulating 27‐OHC using log‐linear regression for repeated outcomes. Polyp phenotypes included any adenomas, advanced adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps. Circulating 27‐OHC was measured at baseline for 1,246 participants. Compared with participants with circulating 27‐OHC below the first quartile (<138 ng/mL), those with circulating 27‐OHC at or above the fourth quartile (?201 ng/mL) had 24% higher risk of adenomas (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05‐1.47) and 89% higher risk of advanced adenomas (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.17‐3.06). Stronger associations were observed among participants with advanced adenomas at baseline. Circulating 27‐OHC was not associated with risk of hyperplastic polyps (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.66‐1.22) or sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.50‐2.07). Circulating 27‐OHC may be a risk factor for colorectal adenomas but not serrated polyps. Prevention Relevance: This study found that plasma concentration of 27‐hydroxycholesterol, a metabolite of cholesterol that regulates lipid metabolism and acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is associated with the risk of developing precursor lesions for colorectal cancer.

AB  -  Lignan intake, and its richest food source, flaxseed, have been associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Endogenous sex hormones, such as estrogens, play a role in breast cancer development, and lignans may alter these sex hormone levels. To assess the effect of flaxseed on circulating sex hormones, a randomized controlled trial was conducted among 99 postmenopausal women in Toronto, Canada. The intervention arm consumed 2 tablespoons (15 g) of ground flaxseed daily for 7 weeks; the control arm maintained usual diet. Baseline and week 7 concentrations of 14 serum sex hormones were measured using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) and immunoassay, and serum enterolignans (lignan biomarker) using LC‐MS/MS. Intervention effects on sex hormone levels were assessed using analysis of covariance. Serum enterolignans increased among the flaxseed arm (+516%). Women consuming flaxseed (vs. controls) had increased serum 2‐hydroxyestrone [treatment effect ratio (TER) = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.18‐2.00] and 2:16α‐hydroxyestrone ratio (TER =1.54; 95% CI: 1.15‐2.06); effects on other hormones were not statistically significant. Within the flaxseed arm, change in enterolignan level was positively correlated with changes in 2‐hydroxyestrone and 2:16α‐hydroxyestrone ratio, and negatively with prolactin. Findings suggest flaxseed affects certain circulating sex hormone levels with possible implications for future breast cancer prevention research.

AB  -  Purpose Bone loss in association with the menopausal transition begins approximately 2 years before the last menstrual period. This study evaluated the efficacy of ALN in comparison to placebo in preventing bone loss in perimenopausal women with low BMD. Methods Inclusion Criteria: Women, aged 4055, experiencing at least five menstrual cycles per year, confirmed FSH level of > 20 iu/L and lower than 40 iu/L on two separate occasions; reduced bone density T < ‐1.0 of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck. Exclusion Criteria: No patient was enrolled if any of the following criteria were met: patients with hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, liver disease, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloma, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, or polycystic ovarian disease; patients treated with any of the following medications less than six months prior to enrolment: androgens, calcitonin, systemic corticosteroids, fluoride, PTH, SERMS, estrogen, oral contraceptives, bisphosphonates, vitamin D > 2000 IU daily, or vitamin D metabolites; patients not clinically euthyroid or who have had a dosage change of > 25 ug of levothyroxine within the previous year; patients with impaired renal function (serum creatinine > 177 umol/L); patients consuming excess alcohol defined as more than four of the following per day: 30 mL of distilled spirits, 340 mL of beer or 120 mL of wine, and subjects with a history of allergy or intolerance to bisphosphonates. Patients with esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia were excluded. Patients with hypocalcemia (corrected calcium < 2.2 mmol/L), patients unable to stand or sit upright for 30 minutes and patients who had a positive beta HCG test on screening were also excluded. Patients meeting study criteria were randomized to either therapy or control groups Therapy consisted of 70mg of Alendronate and 2800 IU cholecalciferol once per week for one year; Control subjects received a placebo tablet. All patients also received 500 mg of supplemental calcium carbonate daily. Biochemistry tests at baseline and 12 months included: bone specific ALP, creatinine, random urine creatinine, and Ntelopeptide (NTX) in serum and urine. BMD was measured by Dualenergy X‐ray absorptiometry at LS,FN, and TH sites. Differences at 12 months in BMD and biochemical markers were compared. Given random assignment, analysis of covariance was performed with the BMD at 12 months as our dependent, the baseline BMD as the covariate, and group (ALN versus placebo) as a fixed factor. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that in perimenopausal women treatment with alendronate over 12 months is effective in lowering bone turnover and improving BMD at the LS. Early intervention with a bisphosphonate for 12 months in the menopausal transition may be effective in maintaining BMD and microarchitectural integrity.

AB  -  Background Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common disease with an annual incidence of 0.5‐1.6 per 1000 in the general population.1‐4 Standard treatment with intravenous or subcutaneous heparin or low molecular heparin relayed with oral anticoagulants is highly effective in preventing recurrent episodes of venous thromboembolism.5 However, oral anticoagulant therapy has a number of limitations including an increased risk of major bleeding and the need for laboratory monitoring to adjust dose. Because of these limitations, venous thromboembolism is usually treated with oral anticoagulants for a limited period of time. Anticoagulants are generally discontinued when the risks and inconvenience of remaining on treatment outweigh the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Indeed, recent studies showed that after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism remains high in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. Recently, four major randomized trials have evaluated extended‐duration treatment with oral anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism. In each of these trials more than 90% of recurrences occurred after oral anticoagulants had been discontinued 6‐9. The rate of recurrence after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants was similar in patients assigned long‐term therapy compared with short‐term therapy (about 15% in the 2‐3 years after warfarin discontinuation) which indicates that although oral anticoagulants are highly effective to prevent recurrence, it have no impact on the natural history of idiopathic venous thromboembolism. Taken together, these data suggest that effective therapy should be continued indefinitely in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism if recurrence is to be avoided. Indeed, once oral anticoagulants are discontinued, there are currently no established safe and effective alternatives to prevent recurrence in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. However, the long‐term use of oral anticoagulants is not only inconvenient because of the need for close laboratory monitoring but also is constrained by an increased risk of major bleeding, including fatal and intracranial bleeding. In randomized trials of extended‐duration oral anticoagulants (target INR 2.0‐3.0) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism,6‐9 the annual incidence of intracranial bleeding was 0.3%, major bleeding 3%, and the case‐fatality rate of major bleeding approximately 10%. In addition, 5‐15% of patients experienced minor bleeding each year. These data highlight the need to identify simple, safe, effective, and widely applicable strategies for the long‐term prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. About 3% of patients with venous thromboembolism experience an arterial cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden otherwise unexplained death) in the 2‐3 years after the first episode of venous thromboembolism10. The long‐term use of oral anticoagulants could potentially prevent these adverse events. Barriers to the more widespread appropriate use of oral anticoagulants include physician concerns regarding the risk of bleeding, particularly in the elderly, as well as the need for close monitoring and regular blood tests to measure the INR. A simple, safe, effective, and widely applicable pharmacological approach is needed for the prevention of these events. The clinical utility of aspirin in the management of venous thromboembolism is a matter of debate. The Pulmonary Embolism Prevention Study 11 demonstrated that 35 days of low‐dose aspirin (160 mg daily) compared with placebo reduced the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, including fatal pulmonary embolism, by about one‐third (RRR 36%, 95% CI: 19‐50%, p=0.0003) in patients undergoing emergency surgery for hip fracture or elective joint arthroplasty. There was no excess of fatal or intracranial bleeding. In the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS)12 2800 postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease were randomized to hormonal replacement therapy or placebo. A secondary analysis showed that the use of aspirin was independently associated with a 50% reduction (95% CI: 20‐80%) in risk of venous thromboembolism during an average of 4.1 years of follow‐up. Taken together, these data suggest that aspirin reduces the risk of a first episode of venous thromboembolism by about one‐quarter (i.e., 25% risk reduction). A systematic overview including more than 8000 patients from randomized trials on antiplatelet primary thromboprophylaxis suggested that antiplatelet therapy was effective to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high risk patients (Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration).13 Antiplatelet therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction [RRR] of 39%; (p=0.00001) in the incidence of venous thromboembolism in high‐risk medical patients or undergoing orthopedic or general surgery. There was no excess in cerebral or fatal bleeding. The European Stroke Prevention Study 2 (ESPS 2)14 evaluated the efficacy and safety of aspirin, dipyridamole (extended‐release preparation), or aspirin and dipyridamole, versus placebo, for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in 6,600 patients. Prespecified secondary analyses found that aspirin resulted in a 30% reduction in venous thromboembolism. Bleeding, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, is the only important side effect of low‐dose aspirin therapy in patients that are not already known to be aspirin intolerant (e.g., allergy). Long term, low‐dose aspirin therapy (i.e., 160 mg per day), is associated with about a two‐fold increase in the risk of bleeding.15‐17 This increase of bleeding is small in patients without known contraindications to aspirin. Evidences from randomized trials of aspirin in asymptomatic subjects, patients with vascular risk factors, or patients with a past history of vascular disease (more than 250,000 patient‐years of follow‐up), showed an absolute excess of major bleeding with aspirin from 0.3 to 1.7 episodes per 1000 patient‐years, equivalent to an absolute risk of 1 event for every 1000 patients treated.15 Increasing doses of aspirin, even within the range of 100‐300 mg per day, were associated with an increasing risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, with the lowest risk occurring in patients receiving 100 mg daily.15;18‐19 In summary, aspirin could achieve a risk reduction of 30 to 40 episodes of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism for every 1000 patients treated, at a cost of 1 bleed requiring transfusion in high‐risk patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. Aspirin is simple to administer and does not require laboratory monitoring. In the present study we propose to evaluate the use of low‐dose aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with previous idiopathic venous thromboembolism who have received initial 6‐month treatment with oral anticoagulants.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Trade Name: METFORMINA TEVA Pharmaceutical Form: Coated tablet INN or Proposed INN: Metformin Concentration unit: mg milligram(s) Concentration type: equal Concentration number: 850‐ Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Coated tablet Route of administration of the placebo: Oral use CONDITION: Breast cancer chemoprevention PRIMARY OUTCOME: Main Objective: The first aim of this application is to conduct a blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effect of metformin on breast cancer occurrence during a five year follow‐up. The study will be conducted on postmenopausal women, 45‐74 years of age. Besides age, women included in the study will be at high risk of breast cancer because of a waist circumference equal to or greater than (&#8805;) 80 centimeters (cm) and the presence of at least another component of metabolic syndrome (MS). Metformin is an antidiabetic drug widely given to patients with chronic conditions etiologically related to breast cancer (type 2 diabetes, elevated levels of androgens and estrogens, impaired glucose metabolism). The study hypothesis is that study participants treated with metformin will have a lower incidence of breast cancer in comparison with women given placebo on breast cancer prevention during a 5‐year follow‐up. Primary end point(s): Breast cancer incidence Secondary Objective: The second aim of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) focuses on the effect of metformin on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) including heart disease and stroke. Because CVDs are the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women and because breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases share several important risk factors, including type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism, the proposed study will target CVD prevention as the secondary aim. The study hypothesis is that study participants treated with metformin will show a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases in comparison with women given placebo and healthy lifestyle information during a 5 year follow‐up. The third aim of this application is to develop a biorepository of blood samples, collected at three time points (before randomization, mid‐term, at the end of the study period). This will create a large biological database for future research INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) Written Informed Consent; 2) Willingness to be randomized; 3) Postmenopausal status (defined as women with no menstrual period for at least 12 months before enrollment in the study); 4) Age 45 to 74; 5) Willingness to provide blood and urine samples; 6) Willingness and capability to be followed for five years; 7) Presence of central obesity, as defined based on a waist circumference ≥ than 80 cm, AND at least one metabolic syndrome component among those reported below: high plasma levels of glucose (≥100 mg/100 mL) high levels of triglycerides (≥150mg/100mL) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality low levels of HDL cholesterol (<50 mg/100mL) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality hypertension (Systolic Blood Pressure≥130 mm Hg or Diastolic Blood Pressure ≥85 mm Hg) or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension Are the trial subjects under 18? no Number of subjects for this age range: F.1.2

AB  -  PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects and toxicities, drug interactions, dosage and administration, and safety issues related to the use of prasterone are discussed. SUMMARY: Prasterone is a proprietary synthetic dehydroepiandrosterone product under investigation for use in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are taking glucocorticoids. Initial trials investigated prasterone as a treatment to improve disease activity and symptoms in women with mild to moderate SLE. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not approve prasterone's labeling for these indications. Subsequent trials have focused on prasterone as a treatment to limit bone loss in women who have SLE. A study was conducted to assess bone mineral density in patients who had been taking glucocorticoids for six months or longer. The patients in the prasterone group showed an increase in bone mineral density, while the placebo group demonstrated a loss. The most common adverse effects of prasterone therapy were acne and hirsutism. Hematuria, hypertension, and serum creatinine concentration increases have also occurred. Interactions of prasterone potentially exist with 5‐alpha reductase inhibitors and additive or antagonistic effects could possibly occur with androgens, estrogens, oral contraceptives, and progestins. In clinical trials, oral prasterone dosages of 100‐200 mg/day were administered. These dosages have resulted in supraphysiological hormone levels. CONCLUSION: FDA has granted orphan drug status for the prevention of loss of bone mineral density in SLE patients taking glucocorticoids. FDA is requesting additional Phase III trial data for the treatment of SLE and the prevention of loss of bone mineral density.

AB  -  Introduction SLE is a chronic inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease with relapsing‐remitting pattern. B‐lymphocyte stimulator was involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. The humanised monoclonal antibody belimumab with 10 mg/kg was effective for active patients. However, the efficacy of low‐dose belimumab for prevention of disease flares in patients with SLE with low disease activity is to be explored. Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Patients who have Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment‐Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA‐SLEDAI) scores no higher than 6; with no A score or no more than one B score on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) scale; and who are treated with prednisone (≤20 mg per day) at screening will be enrolled. 334 adults will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous 120 mg belimumab or placebo (saline) arm on weeks 0, 2, and 4, and then every 4 weeks until 48 weeks, with standard of care. The primary outcome measure is a composite index of severe or mild‐to‐moderate disease flares (SELENA‐SLEDAI Flare Index) within 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes include the percentage of severe flare, the percentage of mild‐to‐moderate flare, time to first disease flare, changes in prednisone dose, SELENA‐SLEDAI, as well as BILAG score, the percentage of patients achieving prednisone free and safety analysis. Ethics and dissemination The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Renji Hospital, Huashan Hospital and the Sixth People's Hospital. The trial has been registered and the detailed information is available at https://clinicaltrialsgov/ct2/show/NCT04515719. The results of this clinical trial will be submitted for publication in peer‐reviewed journals and key findings will also be presented at national and international conferences. Trial registration number NCT04515719.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are experienced by more than two‐thirds of women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy. Safe and effective treatments are lacking. Q‐122 is a novel, non‐hormonal compound that has shown promise for reducing vasomotor symptoms by modulation of oestrogen‐responsive neurons in the hypothalamus. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Q‐122 in women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy and experiencing vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, proof‐of‐concept, phase 2 trial at 18 sites in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligible participants were women, aged 18‐70 years, taking a stable dose of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor following breast cancer and experiencing at least 50 self‐reported moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to oral Q‐122 100 mg or identical placebo, twice daily for 28 days. Randomisation was stratified by BMI (≤30 kg/m2 or >30 kg/m2) and use of any of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, gabapentin, or pregabalin. Q‐122 and placebo capsules were identical in appearance and containers identically labelled. During the double‐blind treatment and analysis phases, the participants, investigators, clinical research organisation staff, and sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean percentage change from baseline in the Vasomotor Symptom Severity Score of moderate and severe hot flushes and night sweats (msVMS‐SS) between Q‐122 and placebo after 28 days of treatment. Primary analysis was by modified intention‐to‐treat and safety was assessed in all participants receiving at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03518138. FINDINGS: Between Oct 24, 2018, and Sept 9, 2020, 243 patients were screened, 131 of whom were randomly assigned and received treatment (Q‐122 n=65 and placebo n=66). Q‐122 resulted in a significantly greater mean percentage change in msVMS‐SS from baseline over 28 days of treatment compared with placebo (least squares mean: Q‐122 ‐39% [95% CI ‐46 to ‐31] vs placebo ‐26% [‐33 to ‐18]; p=0·018). Treatment‐emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate and similar between the two groups (treatment‐related treatment‐emergent adverse events in 11 [17%] of 65 patients in the Q‐122 group vs nine [14%] of 66 in the placebo group); zero patients in the Q‐122 group and two (3%) patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Q‐122 is an effective and well tolerated non‐hormonal oral treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy after breast cancer. Our results support the conduct of larger and longer studies of Q‐122, with potential use extending to postmenopausal women who require an alternative to menopausal hormone therapy.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: The intervention group will participate in strength training three times a week in a 75‐minute training program for 12 weeks. Eight major muscle groups will each be trained in three sets of eight repetitions at approximately 80% of maximum performance and a couple minutes of rest between each set. Each participant's maximum performance will be tested at baseline and every other week thereafter. Every training occasion starts with five minutes of warming up and ends with 10 minutes' cool down. Two weekly training sessions take place in training machines under the supervision of a physiotherapist. One weekly session is performed in the participants' home with the help of an instructive DVD and with their own body weight and rubber bands as resistance. The control group continues their normal contacts with the health care, which during the time of the intervention does not include strength training. At the end of the intervention they will be offered the same strength training program. Patients will be followed up for three months for the intervention group and three months for the control group. CONDITION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) ; Musculoskeletal Diseases ; Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis PRIMARY OUTCOME: Static and isokinetic muscle strength in knee extensors and knee flexors measured electronically with the Kin‐Com.; ; Both the primary and the secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at three month follow up.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: In the United States, approximately one in five men, and one in two women over the age of 50 will have an osteoporosis related fracture, resulting in over two million fractures and $19 billion in related costs each year1. Pharmacologic treatments for osteoporosis have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce the incidence of fractures significantly2, however, even despite good compliance, the observed incidence of treatment failure or inadequate clinical response has been reported to be lower than in randomized clinical trials3. Given that there is a relative paucity of evidence that directly compares the effectiveness of different osteoporosis medications, selecting a medication can be challenging. This study retrospectively used the MarketScan® database to quantify real‐world fracture rates among patients on each osteoporosis medication. It was hypothesized that patients on medications that are more frequently administered orally would have the highest rate of fractures, followed by self‐injectable medications, and then intravenous, intramuscular and medications administered in the hospital and office. METHODS: The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Databases from 2008‐2012 was used to identify patients for the study. The database contains de‐identified demographic information and claims data, as well as medical services and prescriptions for commercial, Medicare supplemental and Medicaid populations. All patients who started a new osteoporosis medication were identified. Only patients who had a 12‐month period of taking no osteoporosis medication leading up to starting the new medication were included in the study. Patients who sustained a fracture within the first 12 months of starting a new osteoporosis medication were excluded from the study to allow time for therapeutic levels and results to be obtained. This cohort was then divided into subgroups by each medication, and the number of patients who sustained a fracture at least 12 months after starting a new osteoporosis medication was recorded, as well as demographic information. RESULTS: Atotal of 101,532 patients met the criteria to be included in the cohort. There were 2,455 patients who sustained afracture (that was not within the first 12 months) after starting a new osteoporosis medication, with an average follow‐up duration of 1,092 days after starting a medication, and 728 days of being monitored for a fracture. The overall incidence rate of fracture was 1.21 per 100 person years of treatment. Results by individual medications are listed in Table 1, along with comorbidities and fracture risk factors. DISCUSSION: The rates of fracture while on treatment medication were opposite of the hypothesis. Medications that are most frequently administered orally actually had the lowest fracture rates, with estrogen being the lowest followed by raloxifene and alendronate. More recently approved and parenteral medications with lower numbers of treated patients had higher rates of fracture while on treatment, specifically teriparatide and denosumab. More established drugs were prescribed much more frequently than newer drugs, especially denosumab, which was first approved in 2010, resulting in less meaningful results in our analysis given its group of only 9 patients. It is also likely that the high number of patients treated with estrogen is the result of patients who were taking it for reasons other than fracture prevention were included in the study, which may also account for its lower fracture rate. It is worth noting trends between genders, with bisphosphonates and especially alendronate popular among males, and alendronate being the most popular behind estrogen among women. The overall rate of 1.21 fractures per 100 person years of treatment is fairly low, and at the lower end of previously reported rates of treatment inadequacy. This is despite no control in this study for compliance, which allows for an intention‐to‐treat approach that is most representative of real‐world outcomes, but may have been expected to produce higher rates of fracture. The study was limited by the date range and information available for from the database that was used. Also, no adjustment of fracture rates for comorbidities or fracture risk factors was made. However, fracture risk factors were fairly similar between drug groups, with the only significant fluctuation being among patients who also had rheumatoid arthritis (Table 1). SIGNIFICANCE: This project reaffirmed the efficacy of all osteoporosis medications, especially for widely used hormone and bisphosphonate medications. It demonstrated more limited use and higher fracture rates among newer osteoporosis medications, without taking into consideration compliance, other risk factors or indications for medication use.

AB  -  MS prevalence increases after the onset of menopause, because of estrogen deficiency. It is still not clear if menopause itself increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in al women or only in those that develop MS. Many MS patients that show slight modification in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters are not generally pharmacologically treated since diabetes or alteration in the lipid profile are not evidenced. In this respect it is of importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat MS. Genistein (4,5,7‐trihydroxyisoflavone), shown a potentially preventive role on the cardiovascular apparatus in post‐menopausal women, may be termed as selective ER modulator (SERM), since it reveals both ER‐alpha full agonist and ER‐beta partial agonist activity. The investigators studied whether genistein may represent an efficacious and safe alternative for reducing vascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. The clinical study was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 150 patients with metabolic syndrome. After a 4‐week stabilization on a standard fat‐reduced diet, participants were randomly assigned to receive either phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and following treatment fasting plasma glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), lipid concentrations, plasma total homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin and visfatin were measured. Bioimpedentiometric and nutritional analysis, as well as a safety assessment of the endometrium and vagina were also performed.

AB  -  Objectives: Women affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a higher risk of endometriosis, an estrogen‐dependent, chronic inflammatory disease. Though acupuncture has long been a safe and effective therapy for treating inflammatory conditions, it is unclear whether it could prevent the onset of endometriosis. This study aims to determine the effect of acupuncture on the subsequent risk of endometriosis in female RA patients. Methods: Between 1998 and 2010, female subjects with RA were recruited from a nationwide database (5,736 patients; age ≥20 years). Enrolled patients included 2,407 acupuncture users and 2,407 nonusers randomly selected using propensity scores. The occurrence of endometriosis was recorded through the end of 2012. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) associated with acupuncture use. Results: During the follow‐up period, 35 acupuncture users and 94 non‐users developed endometriosis, with incidence rates of 2.36 and 4.91 per 1,000 person‐years, respectively. Acupuncture use was associated with a 55% lower endometriosis risk (adjusted HR, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–0.65). Those who received high intensity acupuncture (≥15 packages) had the greatest benefit. Conclusions: Findings suggest that adding acupuncture to conventional therapy may decrease the subsequent endometriosis risk in female RA patients. Prospective randomized trials are recommended to further clarify whether the association revealed in this study supports a causal link.

AB  -  Preterm birth remains the leading public health problem in obstetrics. A recent analysis of neonatal mortality (death at age < 28 days) in the United States between 1989 and 2001 revealed that preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) accounted for 70% of neonatal deaths.9 In addition to being at risk for neonatal death, preterm infants are at increased risk for long‐term neurologic and developmental morbidity, with an estimated risk of significant handicaps in up to 15% of the survivors. These statistics have led many investigators to identify those women at greatest risk (e.g., those with prior preterm delivery, multiple gestations, maternal weight <50 kg, African‐American race, bleeding, and concurrent sexually transmitted diseases). Despite identification of these risk factors, no reproducible and effective method of preventing preterm delivery has been demonstrated. On the contrary, preterm birth rates has risen 27% since 1981.1 A significant contributor to this tremendous rise is the increase in the rate of multiple gestations observed in over the past years. This is partly due to the advances in assisted reproductive technologies with twin gestations accounting for around a quarter of pregnancies conceived following these procedures. The mechanisms of action of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in prolonging gestation are not entirely known. They include relaxation of myometrial smooth muscle, blocking of the action of oxytocin, and inhibition of the formation of gap junctions. There is also evidence that local changes in the progesterone level or the ratio of progesterone to estrogen in the placenta, decidua, or fetal membranes may be important in the initiation of labor in humans. As for its safety profile, aside from local injection‐site reactions like soreness, swelling, itching and bruising, 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate appears to be safe during pregnancy with absence of teratogenic effects. The safety of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate administration in pregnancy is well documented by animal and clinical studies. Reviews of this topic by knowledgeable authors have uniformly concluded that no evidence exists that administration of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in pregnancy represents a significant risk to mother, fetus or newborn. SPECIFIC AIM(S): To test the effectiveness of weekly injections of 250 mg of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate as compared with placebo in the prevention of preterm delivery in patients with twin gestations, when given from 16‐20 weeks of gestation until 36 weeks. We chose the 250 mg dose of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate because this is the dose that was used in the studies that showed a beneficial effect of this medication in the prevention of preterm delivery. The study hypothesis is that placebo is equivalent in its efficacy to 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in preventing preterm delivery in twin pregnancies. to participate in the trial. Randomization procedure: ‐ We will stratify patients by reduced/non‐reduced and IVF/ no‐IVF. Patients will be then randomized to the different treatment groups using permuted block randomization. ‐ Randomization envelopes will be prepared by means of random number tables. Randomization will occur between 16 weeks and 20 weeks of gestation whereby the next numbered opaque envelope will be opened to assign each consenting patient to receive identically appearing active 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (Proluton® Depot, Schering AG, Germany) or placebo (castor oil) injections prepared by our pharmacy. ‐ The women, their obstetricians, and research personnel will be blinded to the study medication allocation. Routine studies and procedures: Interventions: One modality that showed promise for prevention of preterm labor in small trials was treatment with progestational agents. Two separate meta‐analyses assessing the effects of progesterone on preterm labor arrived at contradictory conclusions. Goldstein found no evidence of effectiveness of progestational compounds in the prevention of preterm delivery. Daya, on the other hand, showed a beneficial effect. A third meta‐analysis, restricted to trials of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate showed, in composite, a significant reduction in the rate of preterm delivery. A recently reported trial comparing 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate therapy with placebo to prevent preterm birth in a select, high‐risk group of women (documented history of a previous spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks of gestation) was terminated prematurely when results showed a significant protection against recurrent preterm birth for women who received 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate. Other studies, using the same form of progesterone, did not demonstrate such a beneficial effect. A study in 1980 has failed to show any benefit of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in women with twin gestations. In that study, 77 women with twin gestations were treated during the last trimester with weekly injections of either 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate or a placebo. The study was limited by the small sample size. In addition, the progesterone therapy was started late in the third trimester of gestation which could partly explain the inability to detect a beneficial effect of progesterone in this group of patients using that particular regimen. Most reported trials on other progesterone compounds have failed to demonstrate a substantial effect in reducing the risk of preterm delivery. However, a recent small randomized placebo‐controlled trial of supplemental vaginal progesterone in women at high risk for preterm birth revealed that the preterm birth rate at less than 34 weeks of gestation was significantly lower among women receiving progesterone than among those receiving placebo.8 The results of this study and that of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development7 support the hypothesis that progesterone supplementation reduces preterm birth in a select very high‐risk group of women. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice believes that further studies are needed to evaluate the use of progesterone in patients with other high‐risk obstetric factors, such as multiple gestations, short cervical length, or positive test results for cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin. ‐ A 2:1 ratio will be used for the assignment of women to 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate or placebo, because the patients assigned to placebo would be receiving painful injections on a weekly basis with no possibility of direct benefit. ‐ An ultrasonographic examination, a routine procedure that is done on every pregnant patient, will be performed between 14 weeks and 20 weeks of gestation to confirm the gestational age and to identify any major fetal anomalies. ‐ Gestational age will be calculated based on the last menstrual period and/or first trimester ultrasonography for spontaneously conceived twins and the day of egg retrieval for twins conceived by assisted reproductive technology. ‐ After consenting, the patients will be offered to come for weekly injections of 17‐alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (250 mg) or placebo given by a study nurse. If they cannot come for weekly injections, they will be handled the medications at the time of their follow up visits to their obstetricians to be given by a private nurse, whichever is more convenient for them. In order to avoid the burden on the clinic staff, it was decided to use the OPD premises from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., a time where OPD sessions are over. Flow sheets to document the date of the injection will be available with the RA, obviating the need for pulling out patients charts. The financial compensation of the staff‐nurse will comply with AUMBC rules and regulations. ‐ For those patients who elect to receive their injections at home, they will be called on the day of the injection to remind them of the injection to ensure that they are receiving the medication in due time. ‐ The patient will be categorized as non‐compliant if there is ≥ 10 day‐gap between any two injections. ‐ The injections will be continued until 36 weeks of gestation or delivery, whichever occurs first. ‐ In addition to the weekly visits for the study injections, the women will receive routine prenatal care with her obstetrician. Twin gestations at our department are usually asked to come for routine checkup visits every 3‐4 weeks in the first and second trimester and every 2 weeks from 28 weeks to 36 weeks and weekly thereafter. ‐ The possible side effects of the medication, written in the consent form, will be explained to the patient by the research assistants. ‐ If a patient goes into preterm delivery, she will be managed by her obstetrician according to standard protocols that might necessitate admission and even tocolysis. In these cases, the injections will continue on a weekly basis till 36 weeks of gestation or delivery, whichever occurs first. A Logistic regression model will include all the confounding variables to for check their contribution to the primary outcome. The variables that we are going to control for include: need for tocolysis, BMI, smoking, assisted reproductive technology, prior preterm delivery, prior term delivery, spontaneous or reduced twins, etc …. Prolongation of pregnancy will be assessed by life‐table methods. The duration will be considered as the period between the time of randomization and the time a woman gives birth, is lost to follow‐up, or reaches 40 weeks of gestation, whichever comes first. CLINICAL RELEVANCE AND LIMITATIONS ‐ Managing preterm neonates is a major burden on the health system medically and financially. The results of this study will therefore have major implications if such treatment proves effective in reducing preterm delivery in twins. ‐ Limitations: Since the study is limited to twin gestations, the results cannot be generalized to singletons without risk factors for preterm labor or to higher order gestations. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical package adjusting for the stratified design. The analyses will be done on the intent‐to‐treat basis. Categorical data like maternal characteristics and the rates of neonatal morbidity will be compared using Chi square when sample sizes support the approximation. Otherwise, categorical data will be analyzed with two‐tailed Fisher exact test if the expected cell frequencies were small. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test if assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances appeared to be reasonable or the Wilcoxon rank‐sum test. Unpaired variables and differences in distributions will be compared using the Mann‐Whitney test. Neonatal outcomes will be analyzed on the assumption that if a neonatal outcome variable occurs in at least one of the fetuses, the pregnancy will be considered affected for that variable. A p‐value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests the unique susceptibility of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative (ERPR‐) breast cancer to dietary fat amount and type. Dietary n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may modulate breast adipose fatty acid profiles and downstream bioactive metabolites to counteract pro‐inflammatory, pro‐carcinogenic signaling in the mammary microenvironment. OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of 1 to 5 g/d EPA+DHA over 12 months on breast adipose fatty acid and oxylipin profiles in women with ERPR(‐) breast cancer, a high‐risk molecular subtype. METHODS: We conducted a 12‐month randomized controlled, double‐blind clinical trial of 5g/d vs 1g/d DHA+EPA supplementation in women within 5 years of completing standard therapy for ERPR(‐) breast cancer Stages 0‐III. Blood and breast adipose tissue specimens were collected every 3 months for biomarker analyses including fatty acids by gas chromatography, oxylipins by LC‐MS/MS, and DNA methylation by reduced‐representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). RESULTS: A total of 51 participants completed the 12‐month intervention. Study treatments were generally well‐tolerated. While both doses increased n‐3 PUFAs from baseline in breast adipose, erythrocytes, and plasma, the 5g/d supplement was more potent (n =51, p <0.001). The 5g/d dose also reduced plasma triglycerides from baseline (p =0.008). Breast adipose oxylipins at 0, 6, and 12 months showed dose‐dependent increases in unesterified and esterified DHA and EPA metabolites (n =28). Distinct DNA methylation patterns in adipose tissue after 12 months were identified, with effects unique to the 5g/d dose group (n =17). CONCLUSIONS: Over the course of 1 year, EPA+DHA dose‐dependently increased concentrations of these fatty acids and their derivative oxylipin metabolites, producing differential DNA methylation profiles of gene promoters involved in metabolism‐related pathways critical to ERPR(‐) breast cancer development and progression. These data provide evidence of both metabolic and epigenetic effects of n‐3 PUFAs in breast adipose tissue, elucidating novel mechanisms of action for high‐dose EPA+DHA‐mediated prevention of ERPR(‐) breast cancer.

AB  -  IMPORTANCE: Anti‐double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody has been reported to have a close relationship with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares and participates in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN) as well as causing damage to other organs. However, whether early use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) could prevent SLE flares is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of MMF plus prednisone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate compared with prednisone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate alone in patients with SLE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigator‐initiated, multicenter, observer‐blinded randomized clinical trial enrolled 130 participants aged 18 to 65 years and was conducted in 3 hospitals across China. Treatment‐naive patients with newly diagnosed SLE, a high titer of anti‐dsDNA antibody, and no major organ involvement were included. The study was started September 1, 2018, and the follow‐up was completed September 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (5 mg/kg/d) (control group) or prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (5 mg/kg/d) plus MMF (500 mg twice daily) (MMF group) for 96 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients presenting with flares according to the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment‐Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA‐SLEDAI) Flare Index. The secondary outcomes included the proportion with lupus low disease activity state at week 96, 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey scores before and after treatment, proportion of adverse events (AEs), and changes in SLEDAI‐2000 scores and prednisone doses. RESULTS: Among 130 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 34.5 [12.5] years; 112 [86.2%] women), 119 (91.5%) completed the follow‐up. The risk of severe flare was significantly lower in the MMF group (7 of 65 [10.8%]) vs the control group (18 of 65 [27.7%]) (relative risk [RR], 0.39 [95% CI, 0.17‐0.87]; P = .01). Additionally, 1 of 65 patients in the MMF group (1.5%) and 9 of 65 in the control group (13.8%) manifested LN (RR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.01‐0.85]; P = .008). Most common serious study drug‐related AEs were infections (20 of 65 [30.8%] in the control group and 22 of 65 [33.8%] in the MMF group). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this randomized clinical trial suggest that MMF may reduce the rate of severe flare and lower the incidence of LN in patients with new‐onset SLE and a high titer of anti‐dsDNA antibody without major organ involvement.

KW  -  Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome
AB  -  The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a ginglymoarthrodial joint, a term derived from ginglymus, meaning a hinge joint that allows only forward and backward movement in one plane, and arthrodia, a joint that allows gliding motion, and right and left TMJ are similar to knee articulation. It forms the ellipsoid variety of bicondylar articulation and synovial joints. TMJ movements are defined as elevation, depression, protrusion, retrusion, and lateralization. Primary muscle groups that reveal these joint movements m. masseter, m. temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoid, suprahyoid (digastricus, mylohyoid, geniohyoid, stylohyoid) and infrahyoid (thyrohyoid, sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid). The TMJ ligament complex consists of superficial and deep collateral ligament, sphenomandibular ligament and stylomandibular ligament. While the sensory nerves of the TMJ branch from the Trigeminal (V. Cranial nerve) nerve, they receive sympathetic innervation from the cervical ganglion (C8‐T3). Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. TMD is considered in two groups as articular and non‐articular disorders: articular disorders express the dislocation of the disc with and without reduction, while non‐articular disorders express the problems caused by myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repetitive trauma and overuse of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. ANS is part of the peripheral nervous system (PSS), which regulates involuntary physiological processes such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and digestion, and is anatomically composed of 3 parts: the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) contain afferent and efferent pathways that provide sensory and motor stimulation, and these pathways consist of preganglionic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and postganglionic neurons in the periphery. The SNS enables the body to handle stressors through the "fight or flight" response, and this reaction primarily regulates the blood vessels. The vessels are tonically innervated and in most cases an increase in sympathetic signals leads to vasoconstriction. SNS activation increases heart rate and contraction force. The PNS exits the SNS via cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X, as well as via S2‐4 nerve roots. The vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X), together with the sacral parasympathetic fibers, provides parasympathetic input to most of the thoracic and abdominal organs and has four cell bodies: Dorsal nucleus (parasympathetic stimulation of viscera), Nucleus ambiguous (preganglionic neurons innervating the heart), Nucleus solitarius (taste sense) and Trigeminal nucleus (outer ear circumference receives touch, pain and temperature information). The vagus nerve is responsible for the "resting and digesting" processes. By providing cardiac relaxation, the vagus nerve reduces contraction in the atria and ventricles and decreases the conduction velocity through the atrioventricular node. The vagus nerve also has a significant effect on the respiratory cycle, and its activity increases during expiration, constricting and stiffening the airways to prevent lung collapse. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. It has been shown that TMD patients may show changes in the sympathoadrenal and inflammatory cytokine function resulting from their response to the stressor, and that the increase in the sympathetic activity of these patients in the long term may cause decreased interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and norepinephrine response. It is thought that IL‐6 may be an important factor related to the increased morbidity and mortality in people with chronic stress and may play a pathogenic role in the course of stress‐reactive chronic diseases. Another mechanism thought to cause TMD is that the junctional region between the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) and the upper cervical spinal cord, called the Vc/C1‐2 region, is the primary site for synaptic integration of sensory input from TMJ nociceptors, and Vc/C1‐ It is known that estrogen hormone is effective on the processing of nociceptive stimulus by neurons in region 2. Especially in the post‐menopausal period, the decrease in the level of estrogen in the blood causes an increase in sympathetic activity and causes pain and disability around the TMJ. Another method of evaluating the relationship between TMD and ANS is the measurement of heart rate variability (HRV). In a study, it was observed that HRV, which is a marker of ANS dysfunction, decreased in patients with myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD) compared to healthy individuals. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non‐pharmacological and non‐invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Modulation of the afferent vagus nerve affects numerous physiological processes and bodily states associated with the transfer of information between the brain and the body. These include disease mitigating effects and sustainable therapeutic practices ranging from chronic pain diseases, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders to inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Non‐invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. One of the non‐invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulators in use today, NEMOS®, stimulates the outer ear turbinate and is European Conformity (CE) marked for the European Union for the management of epilepsy. The electrode is connected to a stimulation box and the stimulation intensity can be adjusted by the patient, caregiver, or treating healthcare professional. During use, it is increased in 0.1 milliamperes(mA) steps until the detection threshold of electrical stimulation is reached; the stimulation frequency was defined as 25 Hz. Another non‐invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulator gammaCore® is used for transcutaneous stimulation of the cervical branch of the vagus nerve and is FDA approved for the treatment of episodic cluster headache. The device generates a wave in the form of a pulse. It creates impulses with a 1 ms transition time of an electrical current with a frequency of 25 Hz. The recommended stimulation time is 2 minutes and can be applied up to 12 times a day.

AB  -  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune systemloses its immune tolerance to endogenous nuclear substances due to unknown reasons. Theincidence and prevalence of SLE in different ethnic groups are different, and the overallincidence and prevalence are about 1.4‐8.6/100,000 person‐years and 13‐366.6/100,000person, respectively. The incidence and prevalence of SLE in China are about 4‐10/100,000person‐years and 97.5‐100/100,000 person, respectively. Based on this, it is estimatedthat there are about 1 million patients with SLE in China, which is a major seriouschronic disease. Among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the reportedlifetime incidence of lupus nephritis (LN) is 20%‐60%, depending on the demographics ofthe population studied. Kidney involvement in SLE has been associated with highermortality, especially for patients progressing to kidney failure. The ultimate goal oftreating LN is to preserve kidney function and reduce the morbidity and mortalityassociated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure, while minimizingmedication‐associated toxicities.At present, the pathogenesis of LN remains unclear. A genome‐wide association study(GWAS) conducted by investigators team found that 9 single nucleotide polymorphism lociwere associated with the occurrence of LN. The interaction of multiple factors such asgene polymorphism, viral infection, estrogen, ultraviolet light and smoking leads toincreased production and decreased clearance of endogenous nuclear substances inside andoutside the kidneys in the body, which induce the imbalance of regulation of innateimmune system and adaptive immune system, especially the generation of more long‐livedplasma cells, resulting in continuous production of autoantibodies in kidney, and theydid not respond to standard immunosuppressive therapy. Deposition of antigen‐antibodycomplexes in all parts of the kidneys, which triggers an inflammatory cascade thatincludes complement activation and aggregation of various immune cells such as T cells, Bcells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. Many of them have pro‐inflammatoryphenotypes. These factors eventually put the kidneys in a storm of proinflammation.The clinical manifestations of LN vary from asymptomatic to nephrotic syndrome, acutenephritis syndrome and chronic nephritis syndrome, but the severity of clinicalmanifestations does not match the actual pathological involvement of the kidneys. The2024 EULAR Guideline and the 2024 KDIGO guideline recommend the use of kidney biopsyresults as the basis for standard diagnosis and treatment of LN. Currently, according tothe 2016 revised International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS)classification system, the pathological manifestations of LN are divided into 6 types(I‐VI).Active LN (National Institutes of Health (NIH) activity indexΓëÑ1 with or withoutchronicity index) of Class III, IV or III+V, or IV+V are the focus of clinical treatment.The rationale for classifying LN into different classes is based on differences in theprognosis. Patients with proliferative LN (class III/IV) present the worst prognosiswithout treatment, and the higher rate of refractory response, and patients with classIII, IV, or V LN, but not class I or II LN, are at immediate risk of CKD progression andinvolve irreversible nephron loss that reduces kidneys lifespan. Immunosuppressivetherapy is mostly used for the treatment of class III and class IV and combined with orwithout class V LN, which is divided into two phases: an induction phase with intensiveimmunosuppression, usually lasting 3‐6 months; and a maintenance phase of prolonged, lessintensive treatment to prevent renal flares. The recommended standard first‐linetreatment for these lesions is as follows: initially with glucocorticoids combined withone of the following options: Calcineurin inhibitors(Voclosporin/Tacrolimus/cyclosporine); Mycophenolic acid analogs (MPAA);Cyclophosphamide; Belimumab+MPAA or reduced‐dose cyclophosphamide. The maintenance phaseof treatment mainly includes reducing prednisone to <5 mg/d, and combined withmycophenolate mofetil. The treatment efficacy indicators include the following: completeresponse, partial response, and no kidney response. However, the complete response rateof LN is only 20%‐30% after receiving six months of standard treatment, which is far fromsatisfactory. Refractory lupus nephritis indicates an inadequate response to lupusnephritis therapy. At present, there is no clear definition for refractory cases, whichis defined in 2024 KDIGO Guidelines as no kidney response within initial first‐linestandard treatment.In recent years, in addition to the first‐line standard treatment regimen ofglucocorticoid combined with immunosuppressants. More and more biological agents arebeing developed, including Rituximab, Ocrelizumab, Caplacizumab, Belimumab, Abatacept,Anifrolumab, APL‐2, BI 655064, BMS‐986165, Iscalimab, Obinutuzumab, etc. With theexception of Belimumab and Rituximab were recommended for the treatment of some patientsespecially those in refractory cases, most of these drugs are being studied in clinicaltrials. However, the clinical data of the current treatment are too few, the long‐termtreatment effects of these drugs are not exact, and more new treatment options areurgently needed.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a class of pluripotent stem cells, that are derivedfrom early‐developing mesoderm tissues and can be extracted from bone marrow, umbilicalcord, umbilical cord blood, embryo, adipose tissue, and other tissues. More and morestudies suggest that MSCs can secrete hundreds of cytokines, chemokines, and signalingmolecules involved in immune regulation, and anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrosisprocesses, so they have been actively explored for the treatment of autoimmune diseasesin recent years. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs have been studied using in vitroand in vivo experimental animal models of many autoimmune disorders. Our previous studieshave also shown that MSC can effectively alleviate renal lesions in lupus nephritis miceby regulating the kidney region immunity, especially reduce the number of long‐livedplasma cells and decrease the level of autoantibodies secreted locally in the kidneytissue.At present, more than ten clinical trials of stem cell therapy for LN have beenregistered on the ClinicalTrial website, and among these two trial results have beenpublished. However, the results of the two clinical trials were inconsistent.Human Umbilical Cord‐Mesenchymal Stem Cells (uc‐MSCs) were derived from umbilical cordWharton jelly, which are non‐invasive acquisition, non‐ethical controversy, easy samplingand extraction, low immunogenicity, easy in vitro expansion, and have a strongerimmunomodulatory function and stronger proliferation ability compared with other MSCs.Given that the results of the published clinical studies so far are inconsistent and theoutcome indicators of these clinical trials were not confirmed by the pathologicalresults of kidney biopsy, investigators prompted to design a patient‐blinded, randomized,placebo‐controlled, parallel‐design clinical trial (RCT) to test the safety and efficacyof MSC therapy for refractory lupus nephritis.

AB  -  The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase II trial. The duration of the trial for each subject is expected to be 3 months.160 adult male and female patients with positive COVID‐19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below outlined inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Trial population will consist of both genders. Study Type:Interventional [Change...] Primary Purpose:Treatment Study Phase:Phase 2 Interventional Study Model:Sequential Assignment Number of Arms:3 Masking: None (Open Label) Allocation:Randomized Enrollment:160 [Anticipated] Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 , AT1 protein and Ang II‐mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and this is discussed as follow : Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and SARS‐CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS‐CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two‐fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS‐CoV FP fusion‐relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS‐CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS‐CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion. Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact glomerulus. The L‐type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II‐mediated [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS‐CoV‐2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 (VCAM‐1), intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6).30 but 13cis RA specifically down‐regulated the AT1 protein in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. Down‐regulation of the AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII‐mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with receptor down‐regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1 mRNA .13cRA has a glucose‐ and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition of AT1, Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, and this is discussed as follow : TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. The modulation of its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2 protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full‐length) and 38 kDa (N‐terminus) in a dose responsive manner Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and women. . Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females . The COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐COV‐2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2‐expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type‐I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down‐regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID‐19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS‐CoV‐2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID‐19 treatment by performing target‐based virtual ligand screening.As Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down‐regulator of ACE2. and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell. TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen‐regulated cell‐surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs, TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR). There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p <0.001). Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid‐19, the disease those infected with the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid‐19 they die. More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the devastating disease ‐ it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China ‐ but less than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and just 20 per cent were in women ‐ but the gap has narrowed over time TMPRSS2, a key regulator in prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell lines strongly upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue compared to non‐cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2 gene is a partner in one of the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG. This fusion occurs in approximately 50% of primary prostate cancers among men of European ancestry.While ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 with the ERG gene. The ERG gene is consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion is lower in prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the current COVID‐19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2: ERG fusion‐ cancers also have a distinct set of risk factors related to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor have a higher risk of TMPRSS2: ERG fusion‐positive prostate cancer but not of fusion‐negative prostate cancer According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen‐regulated cell‐surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2. So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex steroids in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non‐steroidal anti‐androgen did not affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5α‐Androstan‐3α,17β‐Diol) concentration in tissues and blood because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because increasing formation of androgenic hormones. A study demonstrated that 13‐ cis ‐Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13‐ cis ‐Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) for membrane fusion. In addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral infectivity. Tamoxifen may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 by inhibition acidification of the endosomes and lysosomes rather than inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. . A study demonstrated that COVID‐19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID‐19 reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a well‐characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2. because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2. Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and functional competence of spermatozoa. A study demonstrated that tamoxifen causes redistribution of weak base chemotherapeutics from acidic organelles to the nucleus in drug‐resistant cells. Agents that disrupt organelle acidification (e.g., monensin, bafilomycin A1) cause a similar redistribution. Measurement of cellular pH in several cell lines reveals that tamoxifen inhibits acidification of endosomes and lysosomes without affecting cytoplasmic pH. Similar to monensin, tamoxifen decreased the rate of vesicular transport though the recycling and secretory pathways. Organellar acidification is required for many cellular functions, and its disruption could account for many of the side effects of tamoxifen. A sudy demonstrated that the phagocytosis is inhabited by tamoxifen and chloroquine in retinal epithelial cells A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have weak base property and increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics. Importantly, TAM treatment enhanced survival of mice injected with a lethal dose of STx1 or STx2,The protective effect was independent of estrogen receptors but dependent on the weak base property of TAM, which allowed TAM to increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics. A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have antimalarial effect via treating mice infected with P. berghei, which show lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of cerebral malaria, Tamoxifen is found to prevent lung fibrosis and reduce serum TGFβ‐1 levels. Astudy demonstrated that Tamoxifen have endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibitory effect better than chloroquine , Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases that play important roles in protein degradation in various cellular processes including both the endocytic pathway and autophagy. The role of cathepsins in viral infection was first identified by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine proteases inhibitor E64d and a specific cathepsin L inhibitor Z‐FY(t‐Bu)‐DMK are able to block the SARS‐CoV infection. Cathepsin D was more sensitive to tamoxifen than to chloroquine. Tamoxifen exposures decreased the cathepsin D activity at less than 10 pM concentrations. The effect of chloroquine started at 15 pM

AB  -  1. Objectives General objective To compare the surgical outcome between SSLF and modified USLS for apical fixation in women undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery Specific objectives 1) To compare the success rate of SSLF and modified USLS for apical fixation at 6 month and one year after vaginal prolapse surgery 2) To evaluate perioperative complications of the two procedures 3) To study the change in pelvic floor disorders symptoms in postoperative period ( 6 months and 12 months) among two groups. 2. Methods 2.1. Recruitment: Women with stage II or higher POP with involvement of apical compartment planned for surgical management will be included in the study. Detailed history will be taken regarding demographic profile like age, parity, menopausal status, mode of previous deliveries, history of smoking, heavy weight lifting. The presenting complaints as well as other associated complaints will be noted. History of previous abdominal or pelvic surgeries will be obtained. For recording the history regarding pelvic floor disorders, PFDI 20 (translated in Nepali language and pretested) will be used. General and systemic physical examination will be performed. The BMI will be noted. The prolapse will be examined and staged according to POP‐Q staging system. Cough stress test and ESST will be performed to rule out SUI. The tests will be performed after reducing the prolapse to rule out occult SUI. The intended prolapse surgery as well as necessary concomitant surgeries will be decided by the surgeon. Informed written consent will be obtained from the participants for including into the trial. 2.2. Randomization: The participants will be randomized on 1:1 basis to one of the methods of vaginal apical suspension either SSLF or USLS. Computer generated randomization table will be generated and used for randomization. The patients will be randomized by one of the residents posted in unit who is not involved in the research one day prior to surgery after pre‐operative examination and decision for surgery is made. 2.3 Surgical procedures The surgeries will be performed by a team of surgeons with technical competency in both the techniques. Method of Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation (SSLF): Women who are randomized to this group will undergo unilateral sacrospinous ligament fixation. For all the women with uterine descent requiring the hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy will be performed using standard method. In women with vault prolapse, the apex of the vagina is grasped with Allis forceps. A horizontal incision is given in the apex over previous scar of vaginal vault. The enterocele sac will be dissected off the vaginal mucosa. The sacrospinous ligament will be accessed via posterior approach. A vertical incision will be given in the posterior vaginal wall leaving 2‐3 cm bridge of vaginal mucosa between the incision and the vault. The right pararectal space will be entered by blunt dissection till the sacrospinous ligament is reached. The rectum will be mobilized medially. Once the ischial spine is identified, SSL is palpated by dorsal and medial movement of the fingers. Any fibroareolar tissue present over the ligament will be removed with the swab held in sponge holding forceps. Per rectal examination is performed to rule out rectal injury. For proper visualization of SSL, Breisky‐Navratil retractor will be used. A permanent suture Polyster no 1 will be passed through the SSL around 1.5 to 2 cm medial to the ischial spine under direct vision with the help of long needle holder. The other end of the suture is brought out to the right end of vaginal vault and it will be tagged. Another suture will be placed in SSL medial to the previous one and again brought out to the vault towards left end and will be tagged. Anterior repair if needed will be performed. The upper portion of posterior vaginal wall mucosa will be closed. The suspension sutures are then tied so that the vagina comes in contact with the SSL without the bridge of suture in between. Posterior colpoperinorrhaphy will then be performed. If anti‐incontinence procedures are needed, will also be performed. Method of Uterosacral Ligament Suspension (USLS) For all the women with uterine descent requiring the hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy will be performed using standard method. The pedicles of the uterosacral ligaments will be tagged. For women with vault prolapse, a horizontal incision will be given at the level of vault. It will be opened and the enterocele sac will be dissected off the vaginal mucosa. The enterocele sac will opened for the intraperitoneal access of uterosacral ligament. The posterior‐cul‐de‐sac will be packed with moist gauze. The remnants of the uterosacral ligaments will be identified medial to the ischial spine. A non‐absorbable suture; Polyster no 1 will be passed through the uterosacral ligament at the level of ischial spine. Another suture with the same suture material will be passed through the ligament around 1 cm below the ischial spine. The one end of the suture is passed through the anterior vaginal wall and the other end through the posterior vaginal wall. Same procedure will be repeated on the other side. Anterior colporrhaphy if needed will be performed. The suspension sutures will then be tied. Posterior colpoperineorrhaphy, anti‐incontinence procedure if needed will be performed thereafter. In case the allocated procedure cannot be performed for vault suspension, alternative surgery will be performed. If both the procedures cannot be performed, the procedure for apical suspension will be decided by the operating surgeon. During the surgery, duration of the surgery, intraoperative blood loss, occurrence of urinary or bowel injury will be noted. Cystoscopy will be performed after each surgery to rule out urinary tract injury. 2.4. Follow up After the surgery the patients will be managed in postoperative wards as per the hospital protocol. The duration of catheterization, post‐operative hospital stay will be recorded. All women will be taught and advised to perform pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) at the time of discharge. The postmenopausal women will be prescribed with local estrogen cream. Following the discharge women will be scheduled for follow up in 6 months and one year of surgery. However, if patient experiences any complications, she is advised to follow up immediately. The complication developed will be managed as needed and the event will be recorded. During each follow up, women will be enquired about the symptoms according to PFDI‐20, POP‐Q examination will be performed. 3. Measurement 3.1. Primary outcome Success rate of SSLF and USLS for apical suspension Success will be defined as absence of any of the following 1. Stage II or greater apical compartment prolapse 2. Awareness of bulge symptoms confirmed by affirmative response to question number 3 of PFDI‐20. 3. Need of additional treatment for prolapse (ring pessary, repeat surgery) 4.2. Secondary outcome Perioperative outcomes Duration of surgery Intraoperative blood loss Duration of catheterization Duration of Hospital stay 1. Complications Bladder, ureteric or bowel injury, neurological injury, vascular injury Urinary retention, Vault hematoma, Dyspareunia 2. Change in PFDI‐20 score The intraoperative blood loss will be calculated by the change in perioperative hematocrit concentration ( difference between pre‐operative hematocrit and hematocrit sent on first postoperative day) using the formula(25); Vloss total = BV X (Hctpreop ‐ Hctpostop) The blood volume will be calculated using the formula(26), BV= k1 x H3 + k2 x W + k3 For females, k1 = 0.3561, k2= 03308 and k3 = 0.1833 5. Adverse events Adverse event (AE) will be recorded as per Clavein Dindo classification of surgical complications which is as follows: Grades Definition Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions. Acceptable therapeutic regimens: drugs like antiemetics, antipyretics, analgesics, diuretics and electrolytes and physiotherapy. Also includes wound infections opened at the bedside. Grade II Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications. Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included. Grade III Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade III‐a: intervention not under general anesthesia Grade III‐b: intervention under general anesthesia Grade IV Life‐threatening complication (including CNS complications) requiring IC/ICU‐management Grade IV‐a: Single organ dysfunction (including dialysis) Grade IV‐b: Multi organ dysfunction Grade V Death of a patient Suffix 'd': If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge, the suffix "d" (for 'disability') is added to the respective grade of complication. This label indicates the need for a follow‐up to fully evaluate the complication Any complications equal to or greater than grade III, will be labeled as Severe adverse events (SAEs). All SAEs will be managed as per the hospital protocol. Any such events will be reviewed thoroughly and the factor responsible for SAE will be identified so as to prevent them in future. 6. Statistical consideration Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be used. The outcome variables will be expressed as frequency and percentage for categorical variables, mean with standard deviation; median and interquartile range for continuous variables. The association between the categorical outcome variables will be sought using Chi square test. The comparison of difference in mean score between the same group will be performed by paired T test while the comparison of means between two different groups will be done by independent T test. 7. Data Management The data will be collected by the principal investigator. The validity and fidelity of the data will be periodically monitored by the DSMB. The data will be collected using preformed proforma and PFDI‐20. The collected data will be coded and entered in Ms Excel spreadsheet. The data will be then analyzed using SPSS version. The primary outcome will be analyzed according to original treatment assignment plan (Per protocol analysis). The success will also be analyzed according to intention to treat analysis.

AB  -  The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase III trial. 10000 adult male and female patients with positive COVID‐19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below outlined inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 , AT1 protein and Ang II‐mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and this is discussed as follow : The COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐COV‐2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa ,intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2‐expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type‐I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down‐regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID‐19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitor which is a protein encoded by SARS‐CoV‐2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID‐19 treatment by performing target‐based virtual ligand screening. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and SARS‐CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS‐CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two‐fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS‐CoV FP fusion‐relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS‐CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS‐CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion. Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact glomerulus. The L‐type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II‐mediated [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS‐CoV‐2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 (VCAM‐1), intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6).30 but 13cis RA specifically down‐regulated the AT1 protein in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. Down‐regulation of the AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII‐mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with receptor down‐regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1 mRNA .13cRA has a glucose‐ and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition of AT1, Isotretinoin(13cis RA) and ATRA may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via inducing the antiviral immunity and this is discussed as follow : Since effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus‐infected cells , boosting the numbers and function of T cells in COVID‐19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID‐19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID‐19 patients, remain uninvestigated. Recent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL‐6, IL‐10 and TNF‐α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL‐6, IL‐10 and TNF‐α concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID‐19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD‐1) as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD‐1 and Tim‐3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune response. MERS‐CoV‐2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in‐vitro .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte‐derived dendritic cells modulates innate immune response. Another study proposed that C ‐C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung DCs‐activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019 Presence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA activates and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+ DCs are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become effector T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is an important signal that induces IgA‐producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells play essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens. Retinoic acid (atRA) can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes in vitro. 13‐cis RA activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell numbers. So, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition by MERS‐CoV‐2. Retinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti‐inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in in both patients and mouse models. .13Retinoic acid (RA) is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active metabolite, all‐trans RA. All‐trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions with TGF‐b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and, Thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance So, principal investigator expects high inducing of Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid treatment which will lead to T cells activation and migration with less exhaustion phenomenon. According to this protocol treatment with retinoic acid will induce FOXP3 and CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage and inducesT cells which were dramatically reduced in COVID‐19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti‐inflammatory effect protecting lung cells and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL‐6, IL‐1, and TNF‐α which are induced and highly expressed in COVID 2019 patients. Researchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels .When the cholesterol level is low specifically in the case of viral infection like COVID 2019 infection the immune system is impaired and the antiviral immune cells will be declined and inhibited :‐ Cellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and ABCA1‐dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels. ATRA upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction of ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response. Retinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T cells by up‐regulating ABCA1‐mediated cholesterol efflux. So, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid treatment will highly induce T cells and anti‐inflammatory regulatory T cells, T helper via cholesterol efflux and inducing ATP‐binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) and protect lung and neural cells and inhibit COVID 2019 infection. The genome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is recognized by melanoma differentiation‐associated protein‐5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene‐1 (RIG‐1) and endosomal toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen‐associated molecular patterns. This recognition resulted in the formation of type‐1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism, virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway. RA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites. AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN‐γ by suppressing TNF production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of PGE2 and COX‐2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages . A study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting IL‐6‐dependent proliferation and TGF‐β1‐dependent trans differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13‐cis‐retinoic acid and other retinoid analogs inhibit IL‐1‐induced IL‐6 production and that this effect is analog‐specific and, at least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose‐dependent with an IC50 of 10(‐7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(‐8) M. IL‐10 production was inhibited by ATRA administration. A study demonstrated that TLR3(‐/‐), TLR4(‐/‐), and TRAM(‐/‐) mice are more susceptible to SARS‐CoV than wild‐type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS‐CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the high level of IFN‐α/β produced from the TLR3‐IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN‐β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can be partially generated during CoV‐2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation and evade the immune response. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral‐signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoid‐induced gene I (RIG‐I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in a time‐dependent. In further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level of IFN‐α/β produced from the TLR3‐IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN‐β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. In HUH‐7 cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV‐1 and induce the expression of IFN‐β, which can enhance the expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I IFN during WNV. Doctors treating the sickest Covid‐19 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.As with so much else about the Covid‐19 response, health experts are learning about the symptom on the fly. Blood clots are common in patients who are immobilized, but they seem to be smaller and cause far more severe damage in some Covid‐19 patients. Doctors have said they see patients with blood clots forming not only in their lungs, but also in blood vessels. Autopsies have also revealed blood clots in kidneys and other organs, which some experts say suggests an overwhelming immune system response to the virus that inflicts harm on the body Retinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo anti‐inflammatory, anti‐platelet and fibrinolytic activities. A study investigated the in vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities of retinoic acid and retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol exhibited potent inhibition of thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid showed the highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin. Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, and this is discussed as follow : TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. The modulation of its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections TMPRSS2, a key regulator in prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell lines strongly upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue compared to non‐cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2 gene is a partner in one of the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG. This fusion occurs in approximately 50% of primary prostate cancers among men of European ancestry.While ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 with the ERG gene. The ERG gene is consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion is lower in prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the current COVID‐19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2: ERG fusion‐ cancers also have a distinct set of risk factors related to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor have a higher risk of TMPRSS2: ERG fusion‐positive prostate cancer but not of fusion‐negative prostate cancer TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen‐regulated cell‐surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs, TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR). There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p <0.001). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2 protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full‐length) and 38 kDa (N‐terminus) in a dose responsive manner Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid‐19, the disease those infected with the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid‐19 they die. More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the devastating disease ‐ it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China ‐ but less than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and just 20 per cent were in women ‐ but the gap has narrowed over time According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen‐regulated cell‐surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2. Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and women. . Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females . So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex steroids in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non‐steroidal anti‐androgen did not affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5α‐Androstan‐3α,17β‐Diol) concentration in tissues and blood because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because increasing formation of androgenic hormones. A study demonstrated that 13‐ cis ‐Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13‐ cis ‐Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) for membrane fusion. In addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral infectivity. A study demonstrated that COVID‐19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID‐19 reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a well‐characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2. because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2. Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and functional competence of spermatozoa. Depending on this data and according to this protocol, The principal investigator expects and suggests that retinoic acid is specific modulator of androgens specifically DHT not testosterone and could reverse the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). (All ideas and michanisms specifically role of Androgen in TMPRSS2 activation in COVID‐19: Serendipity or opportunity for intervention and the inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang II‐mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS‐CoV‐2 cell fusion and entry included in the research protocol were submitted to Academy of scientific research and technology ‐ Egypt‐ on 1 April , 2020. in Call no. 2/2019/ASRT‐ Ideation Fund) _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ Promising features of COVID 2019 treatment according Principal Investigator Protocol: 1. This medication have the feature of Aerosolized Drug Delivery to increase its efficacy beside Oral administration, Which makes it distinct from other medication in which should dose be only given orally. A study demonstrated that treating with 13 cis retinoic acid aerosolized via inhalation rout did not cause any damage in lung cells. Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol‐induced damage. The results suggest that administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to its application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug concentrations in the lung. 2. Inhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells for efficacy while avoiding systemic toxicity. 3. A study demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic is used in treating Emphysema (emphysema is a lung condition that causes shortness of breath) 4. ATRA has been reported to induce formation of new alveoli and returns elastic recoil in the lung to approximately normal values in animal models of emphysema. 5. Strong expectation of complete COVID 2019 blockade from cell entry and infection depending on strong ethics, researches and references. 6. Availability of our compounds. 7. Ease of application. 8. Expectation of COVID 2019 treating of by more than one distinct mechanism. 9. Expectation of High induction of anti‐ inflammatory T cells and significant inhibition of IL‐6 at low concentrations. 10.
