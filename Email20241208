Dear Dr. Dominguez-Bali,

I gain access to all databases in the FIU library. Now the search is completed and the records identified are exported as nbib or ris. 4392 articles are identified. 864 duplicates are detected and resolved, 510 of which are removed.

I also uploaded all files to this GitHub repository: https://github.com/BruceChen034020/EstrogenImmunomodulationSystematicReview

Thank you for your guidance and support. I look forward to your feedback.
Best regards,
Bruce (Kuang-Ying) Chen
